The two species used\\nin herbal healing, both of which are referred to as dami-\\nana, are Turnera aphrodisiaca and Turnera diffusa .\\nDamiana usually grows to a height of about 24 in (60\\ncm). Its pale green leaves, which turn yellow-brown\\nwhen dried, are 0.5–1 in (15–25 mm) long and quite nar-\\nrow . They have serrated (jagged) edges. The leaves and\\nsometimes the stems of the plant have medicinal uses.\\nOther names for damiana include old woman’s broom,\\nMexican damiana, pastorata, hierba del venado, ore-\\nganello, and the bourrique.\\nGeneral use\\nDamiana affects primarily the urinary and reproduc-\\ntive systems. It has been used as an aphrodisiac and to\\nboost sexual potency in men by the native peoples of\\nMexico, including the Mayan Indians, for thousands of\\nyears. It is said to act as a sexual stimulant and produce a\\nfeeling of general well being. Damiana is sometimes used\\nin men to treat spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, sex-\\nual sluggishness, and prostate complaints. It is often used\\nin combination with other herbs to treat impotence.\\nIn the past 100 years, damiana has shifted from\\nbeing primarily a male sexual remedy to also being pre-\\nscribed for women. In women it is used to treat painful\\nmenstruation , menopause disorders, and headaches\\ncaused by menstruation.\\nT oday both men and women may use damiana to re-\\nlieve anxiety, nervousness, and mild depression, especial-\\nly if these symptoms have a sexual component. The herb is\\nalso used as a general tonic to improve wellness. As a gen-\\neral tonic it is said to act as a stimulant, improve circula-\\ntion, and regulate hormonal activity . Some herbal practi-\\ntioners also use it as a diuretic. Damiana tonic should be\\nused moderately , and not be taken on a long-term basis.\\nDamiana has also been used traditionally to improve\\ndigestion and to treat constipation , as in larger doses it\\nhas a mild laxative effect. Other uses include treatment\\nof asthma , cough and flu, and nephritis. During the\\n1960s, damiana was touted as a recreational drug. Some\\nusers claimed that damiana produced a mild “high” or\\nhallucinogenic effect similar to marijuana that lasts an\\nhour to an hour and a half.\\nIn addition to its medicinal uses, damiana is used in\\nMexico to flavor liqueurs, tea, and other beverages and\\nfoods. It tastes slightly bitter, and the leaves have a\\nstrong resinous aroma when crushed. Damiana is ap-\\nproved for food use by the United States Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA).\\nDespite its long history and frequent use in many\\ndifferent cultures, scientists have been unable to isolate\\nany active ingredients that would account for damiana’s\\naphrodisiac, stimulant, or hallucinogenic properties. The\\nherb contains a volatile oil that may mildly irritate the\\ngenitourinary system. This volatile oil may be at the root\\nof damiana’s reputation as an aphrodisiac.\\nThe German Federal Health Agency’s Commission\\nE, which was established in 1978 to independently re-\\nview and evaluate scientific literature and case studies\\npertaining to herb and plant medications, found no proof\\nthat damiana acts either as a sexual stimulant or as a hal-\\nlucinogen. On the other hand, they also found no proof\\nthat damiana was likely to cause harm. A 1999 study on\\nrats conducted in Italy found that extracts of Turnera dif-\\nfusa had no effect on sexually potent rats, but did in-\\ncrease the performance of sexually sluggish or impotent\\nrats. There have been no clinical trials involving humans.\\nPreparations\\nThe leaves and occasionally the stems of damiana\\nare used medicinally .

A modern dancer, she\\nbegan teaching dance after ending her career with the\\nDenishawn Dance Company in 1930. In her classes, she\\nnoticed that some of her students were more interested in\\nthe emotions they expressed while dancing (loneliness,\\nshyness, fear, etc.) than the mechanics of the moves. She\\nbegan encouraging them by emphasizing more freedom\\nof movement rather than technique.\\nIn time, doctors in the community started sending\\nher patients.

Eventually , Chace became part of the staff of the\\nRed Cross at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital. She was the first\\ndance therapist employed in a formal position by the fed-\\neral government. Chace worked with the emotionally\\ntroubled patients at St. Elizabeth’s and tried to get them\\nto reach out to others through dance. Some of them were\\nschizophrenics and others were former servicemen suf-\\nfering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Success for\\nthese patients meant being able to participate with their\\nclass in moving to rhythmic music. “This rhythmic action\\nin unison with others results in a feeling of well-being,\\nrelaxation, and good fellowship, ” Chace said once.\\nChace eventually studied at the W ashington School of\\nPsychiatry and began making treatment decisions about\\nher patients along with other members of the St. Eliza-\\nbeth’s medical team. Her work attracted many followers\\nand the first dance therapy interns began learning and\\nteaching dance therapy at St. Elizabeth’s in the 1950s.\\nOther dancers also began using dance therapy in the\\n1940s to help people feel more comfortable with them-\\nselves and their bodies. These dancers included Trudi\\nSchoop and Mary Whitehouse. Whitehouse later became\\na Jungian analyst and an influential member of the dance\\ntherapy community . She developed a process called\\n“movement in-depth, ” an extension of her understanding\\nof dance, movement, and depth psychology . She helped\\nfound the contemporary movement practice called “au-\\nthentic movement. ” In this type of movement, founded\\non the principles of Jungian analysis, patients dance out\\ntheir feelings about an internal image, often one that can\\nhelp them understand their past or their current life\\nstruggles. One of Whitehead’s students, Janet Alder fur-\\nthered Whitehead’s work in authentic movement by es-\\ntablishing the Mary Starks Whitehouse Institute in 1981.\\nIn 1966, dance therapy became formally organized\\nand recognized when the American Dance Therapy As-\\nsociation (ADT A) was formed.\\nBenefits\\nDance therapy can be helpful to a wide range of pa-\\ntients—from psychiatric patients to those with cancer to\\nlonely elderly people. Dance therapy is often an easy\\nway for a person to express emotions, even when his or\\nher experience is so traumatic he or she can’t talk about\\nit. It is frequently used with rape victims and survivors of\\nsexual abuse and incest. It can also help people with\\nphysical deficits improve their self-esteem and learn bal-\\nance and coordination.\\nDance therapists also work with people who have\\nchronic illnesses and life-threatening diseases to help\\nthem deal with pain, fear of death, and changes in their\\nbody image. Many people with such illnesses find dance\\ntherapy classes to be a way to relax, get away from their\\npain and emotional difficulties for a while, and express\\nfeelings about taboo subjects (such as impending death).\\nDance therapy is suitable even for people who are\\nnot accomplished dancers, and may even be good for\\nthose who are clumsy on the dance floor. The emphasis\\nin dance therapy is on free movement, not restrictive\\nsteps, and expressing one’s true emotions. Children who\\ncannot master difficult dances or can’t sit still for tradi-\\ntional psychotherapy often benefit from free-flowing\\ndance therapy . Even older people who cannot move well\\nor are confined to wheelchairs can participate in dance\\ntherapy . All they need to do is move in some way to the\\nrhythm of the music.\\nDance therapy can be useful in a one-on-one situa-\\ntion, where the therapist works with only one patient to\\nprovide a safe place to express emotions. Group classes\\ncan help provide emotional support, enhanced communi-\\ncation skills, and appropriate physical boundaries (a skill\\nthat is vital for sexual abuse victims).\\nDescription\\nThere are currently more than 1,200 dance thera-\\npists in 46 states in the United Sates and in 29 foreign\\ncountries. Like other mental health professionals, they\\nuse a wide range of techniques to help their patients.\\nSome of the major “schools of thought” in dance therapy\\ninclude the Freudian approach, Jungian technique, and\\nobject relations orientation.

Instead of asking the patient to\\ndance out certain emotions, the therapist instructs the pa-\\ntient to move when he or she feels “the inner impulse. ”\\nThe moves are directed by the patient and the therapist is\\na noncritical witness to the movement. The moves are\\nsupposed to emerge from a deep level within the patient.\\nIn Freudian technique, dance therapists work with\\npatients to uncover feelings hidden deep in the subcon-\\nscious by expressing those feelings through dance.\\nIn object relations technique, the therapist often\\nhelps the patient examine problems in his or her life by\\nconsidering the primary initial relationship with the par-\\nents. Emotions are expressed in a concrete, physical way .\\nFor instance, a patient would work out his fears of aban-\\ndonment by repeatedly coming close to and dancing at a\\ndistance from the therapist.\\nDance therapists sometimes use other types of thera-\\npy along with dance, such as art or drama. Therapists\\nalso discuss what happens during a dancing session by\\nspending time in “talk therapy . ” Dance therapists use vi-\\nsualizations during sessions, too. For example, the thera-\\npist might instruct patients to imagine they are on a\\nbeautiful, peaceful beach as they dance.\\nIn one frequently used technique, the therapist mir-\\nrors the movements of the patient as he or she expresses\\nimportant emotions. This is especially powerful in private\\none-on-one therapy . It is thought that this device provides\\na sense of safety and validates the patient’s emotions.\\nThe underlying premise of dance therapy is that\\nwhen people dance, they are expressing highly significant\\nemotions. A fist thrust out in anger into the air or a head\\nbent in shame has deep significance to a dance therapist.\\nThrough dance therapy , the theory goes, patients are able\\nto more easily express painful, frightening emotions, and\\ncan progress from there. After experiencing dance thera-\\npy , they can talk about their feelings more freely and tear\\ndown the barriers they have erected between themselves\\nand other people. The hope is that eventually they can go\\non to live more psychologically healthy lives.\\nPreparations\\nPeople who want to use dance therapy should find a\\nqualified therapist. The ADT A provides lists of qualified\\ntherapists. The person should begin dance therapy with\\nan open mind and a willingness to participate so he or\\nshe can get the most benefit.\\nPrecautions\\nA qualified dance therapist should have completed a\\ngraduate program in dance therapy approved by the\\nADT A and should be registered with the ADT A. He or\\nshe should not just be a dancer, but should also have ex-\\ntensive training in psychology .\\nSide effects\\nNo known side effects.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nDance therapy was once dismissed as simply an in-\\neffective, “feel good” treatment, but it is now more re-\\nspected. Many research studies have proven that dance\\ntherapy can be an effective tool to help people overcome\\npsychological problems.\\nIn a 1993 study , older people with cognitive deficits\\nshowed that dance therapy could significantly increase\\ntheir functional abilities. Patients improved their balance,\\nrhythmic discrimination, mood, and social interaction.\\nIn 1999, a pilot study of 21 university students\\nshowed that those who took a series of four to five group\\ndance therapy sessions in a period of two weeks signifi-\\ncantly reduced their test anxiety as measured by a well-\\nknown exam called the T est Anxiety Inventory . After-\\nwards, the subjects reported that their dance movement\\nexperience was positive and provided them with psycho-\\nlogical insight. The researchers concluded that dance\\ntherapy could be a viable method of treatment for stu-\\ndents who suffer from overwhelming test anxiety , and\\nshould be researched further.\\nIn another 1999 study presented at the ADT A nation-\\nal conference in November 1999, dance therapist Donna\\nNewman-Bluestein reported success in using techniques\\nof dance therapy with cardiac patients. In a stress reduc-\\ntion class, health professionals used dance therapy meth-\\nods to teach body awareness, relaxation, self-expression,\\ncreativity , and empathy . According to Newman-Bluestein,\\nthe dance therapy techniques helped the patients deal with\\nsuch stressful emotions as anger, increased their self-\\nawareness, made them more relaxed, and helped them ad-\\njust emotionally to having heart disease.\\nT raining & certification\\nDance therapists should have dance experience and\\na liberal arts background with coursework in psychology\\nfor their undergraduate degree.

This sun-loving beauty is a native of Greece,\\nnaturalized in temperate regions throughout the world,\\nand familiar to nearly everyone. The perennial dandelion\\ngrows freely wherever it can find a bit of earth and a\\nplace in the sun. Dandelion’s nutritive and medicinal\\nqualities have been known for centuries.\\nDandelion’s common name is derived from the French\\ndent de lion, a reference to the irregular and jagged mar-\\ngins of the lance-shaped leaves. There are numerous folk\\nnames for this widely-used herb. They include pissabed,\\nIrish daisy , blow ball, lion’s tooth, bitterwort, wild endive,\\npriest’s crown, doonheadclock, yellow gowan, puffball,\\nclock flower, swine snort, fortune-teller, and cankerwort.\\nThe generic name is thought to be derived from the Greek\\nwords taraxos, meaning disorder, and akos, meaning reme-\\ndy . Another possible derivation is from the Persian tark\\nhashgun, meaning wild endive, one of dandelion’s com-\\nmon names. The specific designation officinale indicates\\nthat this herb was officially listed as a medicinal. Dande-\\nlion held a place in the United States National F ormulary\\nfrom 1888 until 1965, and the dried root of dandelion is\\nlisted in the United States Pharmacopoeia(USP).\\nDandelion may be distinguished from other similar-\\nlooking herbs by the hollow , leafless flower stems that\\ncontain a bitter milky-white liquid also found in the root\\nand leaves.

(Photograph by Robert J. Huff-\\nman/Field Mark Publications. Reproduced by permission.)\\npeople soon recognized the value of the herb and sought\\nit out for its medical and nutritious benefits. The entire\\nplant is important as a general tonic, particularly as a\\nliver tonic. It may be taken as an infusion of the leaf, a\\njuice extraction, a root decoction, or a tincture. Fresh\\nleaves may be added to salads or cooked as a potherb.\\nThe juice extracted from the stem and leaf is the most\\npotent part of the plant for medicinal purposes. It has\\nbeen used to eradicate warts and soothe calluses, bee\\nstings, or sores. Infusions of dandelion blossoms have\\nbeen used as a beautifying facial, refreshing the skin.\\nDandelion is a nutritive herb rich in potassium ,\\ncalicum, and lecithin , with iron, magnesium , niacin ,\\nphosphorus , proteins, silicon, boron, and zinc. Dande-\\nlion provides several B vitamins along with vitamins C\\nand E as well as vitamin P . Chemical constituents in the\\nleaf include bitter glycosides, carotenoids , terpenoids,\\ncholine, potassium salts, iron, and other minerals. The\\nroot also has bitter glycosides, tannins, triterpenes,\\nsterols, volatile oil, choline, asparagin, and inulin.\\nMany herbalists regard the dandelion as an effective\\ntreatment for liver disease, useful even in such extreme\\ncases as cirrhosis . It cleanses the bloodstream and in-\\ncreases bile production, and is a good remedy for gall\\nbladder problems as well. The herb is also a boon to such\\nother internal organs as the pancreas, kidneys, stomach,\\nand spleen. The dried leaf, taken as a tea, is used as a\\nmild laxative to relieve constipation . Dandelion leaf is\\nalso a good natural source of potassium, and will replen-\\nish any potassium that may be lost due to the herb’ s di-\\nuretic action on the kidneys. This characteristic makes\\ndandelion a safe diuretic in cases of water retention due\\nto heart problems.The herb is useful in cases of anemia\\nand hepatitis , and may lower elevated blood pressure.\\nDandelion may also provide relief for rheumatism and\\narthritis. Dandelion therapy , consisting of therapeutic\\ndoses of dandelion preparations taken over time, may\\nhelp reduce stiffness and increase mobility in situations\\nof chronic degenerative joint disease. The root, dried and\\nminced, can used as a coffee substitute, sometimes com-\\nbined with roasted acorns and rye.\\nPreparations\\nAll parts of the dandelion have culinary and medici-\\nnal value. It is best to harvest fresh young dandelion\\nleaves in the spring. The small, young leaves are less bit-\\nter, and may be eaten uncooked in salads. Larger leaves\\ncan be lightly steamed to reduce bitterness. Leaves gath-\\nered in the fall are naturally less bitter. Dandelion blos-\\nsoms, traditionally used in wine making, may be gath-\\nered throughout the flowering season. The deep, fleshy\\ntaproot should be gathered in the fall. It takes careful\\ndigging and loosening to extract the root intact, although\\nlovely magenta tint that extends up along the inner rib of\\nthe stalkless leaf. When the plant is used as a dye, it\\nyields this purple hue. Dandelion blossoms are singular\\nand round, with compact golden-yellow petals. They\\nbloom from early spring until well into autumn atop hol-\\nlow stalks that may reach from 4–8 in (10.2ndash;20.3\\ncm) tall. The golden blossoms yield a pale yellow dye\\nfor wool. After flowering, dandelion develops a round\\ncluster of achenes, or seed cases. As many as 200 of\\nthese narrow seed cases, each with a single seed, form\\nthe characteristic puffball. Each achene is topped with a\\nwhite, feathery tuft to carry it on the breeze. Dandelion’s\\ntap root may grow fat, and reach as deep as 1.5 ft (45.7\\ncm) in loose soil. The root has numerous hairy rootlets.\\nDandelion is a hardy herb and will regrow from root\\nparts left in the ground during harvest.\\nGeneral use\\nDandelion has a long history of folk use.

It is a natural and\\nharmless scalp condition in which the shedding of dead\\nskin cells occurs at an unusually fast rate. Because of the\\noily skin often associated with this condition, these cells\\nclump together and flake off as dandruff.\\nDescription\\nDandruff is very common. Up to one-third of the\\nU.S. population is affected by this condition. While it is\\nnot considered a disease, dandruff is a cosmetic concern\\nfor many people.\\nThe following problems tend to exacerbate dan-\\ndruff:\\nany root parts left in the soil will eventually produce an-\\nother plant. The root should be washed. Thicker roots\\nshould be sliced down their length to facilitate drying.\\nThe pieces should be spread out on a paper-lined tray in\\na light, airy room out of direct sunlight and stored in\\ntightly sealed dark glass containers. Dried dandelion root\\nmay be somewhat less potent than the fresh root.\\nLeaf infusion: Place 2 oz of fresh dandelion leaf, less\\nif dried, in a warmed glass container. Bring 2.5 cups of\\nfresh nonchlorinated water to the boiling point and add it\\nto the herbs. Cover the mixture and steep for 15–20 min-\\nutes, then strain. Drink the infusion warm or cold through-\\nout the day , up to three cups per day . The prepared tea can\\nbe kept for about two days in the refrigerator.\\nTincture: Combine 4 oz of finely-cut fresh dande-\\nlion root and leaf (or 2 oz of dry powdered herb) with 1\\npt of brandy , gin, or vodka in a glass container. The alco-\\nhol should be enough to cover the plant parts and have a\\n50/50 ratio of alcohol to water. Cover and store the mix-\\nture away from light for about two weeks, shaking sever-\\nal times each day . Strain and store in a tightly capped\\ndark glass bottle. A standard dose is 10–15 drops of the\\ntincture in water, up to three times a day .\\nPrecautions\\nDandelion acts as a cholagogue, which means that it\\nincreases the flow of bile. It should not be used by per-\\nsons with closure of the biliary ducts and other biliary\\nailments.\\nSide effects\\nDandelion is a safe and nutritious herb widely used\\nthroughout the world. No health hazards have been re-\\nported when dandelion is used in designated therapeutic\\ndoses. According to the PDR F or Herbal Medicine,h o w -\\never, some “superacid gastric complaints” could be trig-\\ngered by using the herb. Dandelion stems contain a liq-\\nuid latex substance that may be irritating to the skin of\\nsenstitive persons.\\nInteractions\\nNo interactions have been reported between dande-\\nlion and standard medications.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nDuke, James A., Ph.D. The Green Pharmacy.

It is not known what accelerates\\nthis cell growth. However, scientists have suggested that\\ndandruff may be a hypersensitive reaction to the prolifer-\\nation of Pityrosporum ovale, a yeast that occurs naturally\\non the scalp. Another theory that held for some time\\nlinked dandruff to a fungus. A 2002 report said that sci-\\nentists had identified new fungi of the Malassezia that\\nseem to exist in overabundance on the scalps of those af-\\nfected with the disease.\\nDiagnosis\\nDandruff is easy to diagnose. The condition is char-\\nacterized by the appearance of white flakes on the hair or\\non the shoulders and collar. People with oily hair tend to\\nhave dandruff more often. Dandruff usually does not re-\\nquire medical treatment. However, if, in addition to dan-\\ndruff, a person also has greasy scaling on the face, eye-\\nbrows and eyelashes and thick, red patches on the body ,\\nhe or she may have the more severe form of seborrheic\\ndermatitis. This condition may require medical advice\\nand treatment.\\nT reatment\\nAlternative treatments for dandruff include nutri-\\ntional therapy , herbal therapy and relaxation therapy .\\nNutritional therapy\\nThe following nutritional changes may be helpful:\\n• Identification and avoidance of potential allergenic\\nfoods.\\n• Limited intake of milk and other dairy products,\\nseafoods and fatty treats. These foods tend to exacer-\\nbate dandruff.\\n• Reduction or elimination of animal proteins and eating\\nmostly whole grains, fresh vegetables, beans and fruit.\\n• A voiding citrus until dandruff clears.\\n• Diet supplemented with B-complex vitamins which\\nmay alleviate dandruff condition.\\n• A voiding excess salt, sugar, and alcohol.\\n• T aking 1 tablespoon of flaxseed oil per day . Flaxseed\\noil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which may be effec-\\ntive in treating a variety of skin conditions including\\ndandruff.\\nFrom a traditional medical approach, dandruff may\\nbe the body’s way of eliminating excess protein accumu-\\nlated but not assimilated in the system. It may also be a\\nsymptom of liver and kidney imbalances. A more stabi-\\nlizing diet is needed, reducing highly acidic foods such\\nas tomatoes and certain spices.\\nHerbal therapy\\nMassaging tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia ) into\\nthe scalp may help prevent or relieve dandruff. This oil\\ncan relieve scaling and itching. A yurvedic treatment also\\nincludes various oil therapies, called suehana for the\\nhead. Increased exercise can increase circulation and\\nhelp eliminate fats and oils.\\nRelaxation therapies\\nRelaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga\\nmay help relieve stress, which exacerbates dandruff.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThere is no cure for this natural harmless skin con-\\ndition. Because a greasy scalp is associated with dan-\\ndruff condition, more frequent hair washing using regu-\\nlar shampoo is usually all that is needed. In more severe\\ncases, medicated shampoo may be necessary .\\nThe two most commonly used anti-dandruff sham-\\npoos are selenium sulfide and zinc pyrithione. Both of\\nthese are cytostatic agents. Cytostatic drugs slow down\\nthe growth and formation of top skin layer on the scalp.\\nT o get the best result, one should leave the shampoo on\\nfor as long as possible. It is recommended that a person\\nlather the anti-dandruff shampoo at the beginning of the\\nshower, leave it on until the end of the shower, then rinse,\\nlather, and rinse again. As a result of treatment with any\\nof these drugs, dandruff will become less noticeable. Be-\\ncause it can be irritating, shampoo containing selenium\\nsulfide should not be used if the skin is cut or abraded.\\nProducts containing salicylic acid and sulfur are re-\\nserved for more severe cases. Salicylic acid loosens the\\ndead skin cells so that they can be sloughed off more\\neasily . Sometimes, antibacterial shampoos are used to re-\\nduce bacteria on the scalp.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2594\\nDandruff\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:23 PM  Page 594'),\n",

It is\\nused differently than herbal licorice because it is much\\nhigher in agents that soothe or heal mucous membranes,\\nand lower in other constituents found in licorice root and\\nfull extracts of licorice root. DGL may also be spelled,\\ndeglycyrrhizinated liquorice. The herb, licorice, from\\nwhich DGL is derived, is known by the names Gly-\\ncyrrhiza , sweet root, and Y asti-madhu with the gly-\\ncyrrhizin removed.\\nLicorice is a perennial herb, which is native to the\\nMiddle East, and widely cultivated in Europe, the Mid-\\ndle East, and Asia. The root has a long history of use as a\\nRecently , antifungal products, such as ketoconazole\\n(Nizoral) shampoos, are available over-the-counter (1%\\npreparation) and by prescription (2% preparation). These\\nshampoos are often prescribed by dermatologists to reduce\\nthe growth of P . ovale. These preparations may be helpful\\nif dandruff is not relieved by other shampoo treatments.\\nThe most severe and recalcitrant dandruff conditions\\nmay require tar shampoos. These shampoos reduce the\\ngrowth of top skin cells on the scalp. It is recommended\\nthat the shampoo be left on the hair for at least 10 min-\\nutes for best results. Coal tar shampoos can be messy\\nand can stain blond or white hair. Coal tar also can be\\ncarcinogenic (causing cancer ). However, the FDA ap-\\nproves this product because when used as shampoo, be-\\ncause it contacts the scalp for only a short period of time.\\nStill, it is a good idea to use alternative treatments for\\nthis relatively harmless condition.\\nBecause anti-dandruff shampoos may lose effective-\\nness after a while, it may be helpful to rotate between a\\nmedicated shampoo and a regular shampoo or try a dif-\\nferent type of anti-dandruff shampoo.\\nExpected results\\nWhile one can not cure dandruff, it can be easily\\nmanaged. A mild dandruff condition often responds to\\nmore frequent hair washes with regular shampoo. More\\nsevere conditions may require anti-dandruff preparations.\\nPrevention\\nPreventive measures include regular hair washing,\\nreducing stress, eating healthy foods and increasing hu-\\nmidity inside the house. In addition, excessive use of hair\\ncurlers, hair sprays and gels, and frequent hair coloring\\nshould be avoided.

Ul-\\ncers in the stomach are known as peptic ulcers, while\\nthose in the small intestine are duodenal ulcers. DGL has\\nbeen studied for the treatment of peptic and duodenal ul-\\ncers, and appears to be both safe and effective for long-\\nterm maintenance therapy for certain patients who have\\nthese ulcers.

The loss of cognitive abilities that\\noccurs with dementia leads to impairments in memory ,\\nreasoning, planning, and personality . While the over-\\nwhelming number of people with dementia are elderly , it\\nis not an inevitable part of aging . Instead, dementia is\\ncaused by specific brain diseases. Alzheimer’s disease\\nis the most common cause, followed by vascular or\\nmulti-infarct dementia.\\nThe prevalence of dementia has been difficult to de-\\ntermine, partly because of differences in definition\\namong different studies, and partly because there is some\\nnormal decline in functional ability with age. Dementia\\naffects 5–8% of all people between ages 65 and 74, and\\nup to 20% of those between 75 and 84. Estimates for de-\\nmentia in those 85 and over range from 30–47%. Be-\\ntween two and four million Americans have Alzheimer’s\\ndisease; that number is expected to grow to as many as\\n14 million by the middle of the twenty-first century as\\nthe population as a whole ages.\\nThe cost of dementia can be considerable. While\\nmost people with dementia are retired and do not suffer\\nincome losses from their disease, the cost of care is often\\nenormous. Financial burdens include lost wages for fam-\\nily caregivers, medical supplies and drugs, and home\\nmodifications to ensure safety . Nursing home care may\\ncost several thousand dollars a month or more. The psy-\\nchological cost is not as easily quantifiable but can be\\neven more profound. The person with dementia loses\\ncontrol of many of the essential features of his life and\\npersonality , and loved ones lose a family member even\\nas they continue to cope with the burdens of increasing\\ndependence and unpredictability .\\nCauses & symptoms\\nCauses\\nDementia is usually caused by degeneration of brain\\ncells in the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain responsi-\\nble for thoughts, memories, actions, and personality .\\nDeath of brain cells in this region leads to the cognitive\\nimpairment that characterizes dementia.\\nThe most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s\\ndisease (AD), accounting for half to three quarters of all\\ncases. The brain of a person with AD becomes clogged\\nwith two abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tan-\\ngles and senile plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twist-\\ned masses of protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons.\\nSenile plaques are composed of parts of neurons sur-\\nrounding a group of proteins called beta-amyloid de-\\nposits. Why these structures develop is unknown. Cur-\\nrent research indicates possible roles for inflammation,\\nblood flow restriction, and accumulation of aluminum in\\nthe brain and toxic molecular fragments known as free\\nradicals or oxidants.\\nSeveral genes have been associated with higher inci-\\ndences of AD, although the exact role of these genes is still\\nunknown. In 2001, investigators discovered a rare mutation\\nin the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that is linked to\\nearly-onset Alzheimer’s. The discovery points scientists to\\nnew ideas for targeting and treating the disease.\\nV ascular dementia is estimated to cause from\\n5–30% of all dementias. It occurs from a decrease in\\nblood flow to the brain, most commonly due to a series\\nof small strokes (multi-infarct dementia). Other cere-\\nbrovascular causes include: vasculitis from syphilis ,\\nLyme disease , or systemic lupus erythematosus ; sub-\\ndural hematoma; and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Be-\\ncause of the usually sudden nature of its cause, the\\nsymptoms of vascular dementia tend to begin more\\nabruptly than those of Alzheimer’s dementia. Symptoms\\nmay progress stepwise with the occurrence of new\\nstrokes. Unlike AD, the incidence of vascular dementia\\nis lower after age 75.\\nOther conditions which may cause dementia include:\\n• AIDS\\n• Parkinson’s disease\\n• Lewy body disease\\n• Pick’s disease\\n• Huntington’s disease\\n• Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease\\n• brain tumor\\n• hydrocephalus\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 597\\nDementia\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:23 PM  Page 597'),\n",

Losses eventually af-\\nfect virtually every aspect of mental functioning. The\\nslow progression of dementia is in contrast with deliri-\\num, which involves some of the same symptoms, but has\\na very rapid onset and fluctuating course with alteration\\nin the level of consciousness. However, delirium may\\noccur with dementia, especially since the person with\\ndementia is more susceptible to the delirium-inducing\\neffects of may types of drugs.\\nSymptoms include:\\n• Memory losses. Short-term memory loss is usually the\\nfirst symptom noticed. It may begin with misplacing\\nvaluables such as a wallet or car keys, then progress to\\nforgetting appointments, where the car was left, and the\\nroute home, for instance. More profound losses may\\neventually follow , such as forgetting the names and faces\\nof family members.\\n• Impaired abstraction and planning. The person with de-\\nmentia may lose the ability to perform familiar tasks, to\\nplan activities, and to draw simple conclusions from facts.\\n• Language and comprehension disturbances. The person\\nmay be unable to understand instructions, or follow the\\nlogic of moderately complex sentences. Later, he or she\\nmay not understand his or her own sentences, and have\\ndifficulty forming thoughts into words.\\n• Poor judgment. The person may not recognize the con-\\nsequences of his or her actions or be able to evaluate\\nthe appropriateness of behavior. Behavior may become\\ncrude or offensive, overly-friendly , or aggressive. Per-\\nsonal hygiene may be ignored.\\n• Impaired orientation ability . The person may not be\\nable to identify the time of day , even from obvious vi-\\nsual clues; or may not recognize his or her location,\\neven if familiar. This disability may stem partly from\\nlosses of memory and partly from impaired abstraction.\\n• Decreased attention and increased restlessness. This\\nmay cause the person with dementia to begin an activity\\nand quickly lose interest, and to wander frequently .\\nW andering may cause significant safety problems, when\\ncombined with disorientation and memory losses. The\\nperson may begin to cook something on the stove, then\\nbecome distracted and wander away while it is cooking.\\n• Personality changes and psychosis. The person may\\nlose interest in once-pleasurable activities, and become\\nmore passive, depressed, or anxious. Delusions, suspi-\\ncion, paranoia, and hallucinations may occur later in\\nthe disease. Sleep disturbances may occur, including\\ninsomnia and sleep interruptions.\\nDiagnosis\\nSince dementia usually progresses slowly , diagnos-\\ning it in its early stages can be difficult. Several office vis-\\nits over several months or more may be needed. Diagno-\\nsis begins with a thorough physical exam and complete\\nmedical history , usually including comments from family\\nmembers or caregivers. A family history of either\\nAlzheimer’s disease or cerebrovascular disease may pro-\\nvide clues to the cause of symptoms. Simple tests of men-\\ntal function, including word recall, object naming, and\\nnumber-symbol matching, are used to track changes in\\nthe person’s cognitive ability . Recent studies suggest that\\npositron emissions tomography (PET) scans of the brain\\nmight be able to identify those at risk for Alzheimer’s. As\\nthese tests become more widely available, they may offer\\nhope for earlier detection of dementia.\\nDepression is common in the elderly and can be\\nmistaken for dementia; therefore, ruling out depression\\nis an important part of the diagnosis. Distinguishing de-\\nmentia from the mild normal cognitive decline of ad-\\nvanced age is also critical. The medical history includes\\na complete listing of drugs being taken, since a number\\nof drugs can cause dementia-like symptoms.\\nDetermining the cause of dementia may require a va-\\nriety of medical tests, chosen to match the most likely eti-\\nology . Cerebrovascular disease, hydrocephalus, and tu-\\nmors may be diagnosed with x rays, CT or MRI scans,\\nand vascular imaging studies. Blood tests may reveal nu-\\ntritional or metabolic deficiencies or hormone imbalances.\\nT reatment\\nNutritional supplements\\nSome nutritional supplements may be helpful, espe-\\ncially if dementia is caused by deficiency of these essen-\\ntial nutrients:\\n• Acetyl-L-carnitine: improves brain function and increas-\\nes attention span, enhances ability to concentrate and in-\\ncreases energy in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.\\n• Antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene, or\\nselenium): may slow down disease progression by pre-\\nventing the damaging effects of free radicals.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2598\\nDementia\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:23 PM  Page 598'),\n",

Ginkgo extract, derived from the\\nleaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, interferes with a circu-\\nlatory protein called platelet-activating factor. It also in-\\ncreases circulation and oxygenation to the brain. Ginkgo\\nextract has been used for many years in China and is\\nwidely prescribed in Europe for treatment of circulatory\\nproblems. A 1997 study of patients with dementia ap-\\npeared to show that gingko extract could improve their\\nsymptoms.

However,\\nits effectiveness has not been supported by clinical stud-\\nies. In addition, this form of therapy may cause kidney\\ndamage. Therefore, it should only be given under watch-\\nful eyes of a qualified physician.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThere are no therapies that can reverse the progres-\\nsion of Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, treatment of de-\\nmentia begins with treatment of the underlying disease\\nwhen possible. Aspirin, estrogen, vitamin E, selegiline,\\npropentofylline and milameline are currently being eval-\\nuated for their ability to slow the rate of progression.\\nCare for a person with dementia can be difficult and\\ncomplex. The patient must learn to cope with functional\\nand cognitive limitations, while family members or other\\ncaregivers assume increasing responsibility for the per-\\nson’s physical needs.\\nSymptoms of dementia may be treated with a\\ncombination of psychotherapy , environmental modifi-\\ncations and medication. Behavioral approaches may be\\nused to reduce the frequency or severity of problem\\nbehaviors, such as aggression or socially inappropriate\\nconduct.\\nModifying the environment can increase safety and\\ncomfort while decreasing agitation. Home modifications\\nfor safety include removal or lock-up of hazards such as\\nsharp knives, dangerous chemicals, and tools. Child-\\nproof latches or Dutch doors may be used to limit access\\nas well. Lowering the hot water temperature to 120°F\\n(48.9°C) or less reduces the risk of scalding. Bed rails\\nand bathroom safety rails can be important safety mea-\\nsures, as well. Confusion may be reduced with simpler\\ndecorative schemes and presence of familiar objects.\\nCovering or disguising doors (with a mural, for example)\\nmay reduce the tendency to wander.

Each year\\nin the United States, depression affects an estimated 17\\nmillion people at an approximate annual direct and indi-\\nrect cost of $53 billion. One in four women is likely to ex-\\nperience an episode of severe depression in her lifetime,\\nwith a 10–20% lifetime prevalence, compared to 5–10%\\nfor men. The average age a first depressive episode occurs\\nis in the mid-20s, although the disorder strikes all age\\ngroups indiscriminately , from children to the elderly .\\nThere are two main categories of depression: major\\ndepressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major de-\\npressive disorder is a moderate to severe episode of de-\\npression lasting two or more weeks. Individuals experi-\\nencing this major depressive episode may have trouble\\nsleeping, lose interest in activities in which they once\\ntook pleasure, experience a change in weight, have diffi-\\nculty concentrating, feel worthless and hopeless, or have\\na preoccupation with death or suicide. In children, major\\ndepression may appear as irritability .\\nWhile major depressive episodes may be acute (in-\\ntense but short-lived), dysthymic disorder is an ongoing,\\nchronic depression that lasts two or more years (one or\\nmore years in children) and has an average duration of 16\\nyears. The mild to moderate depression of dysthymic dis-\\norder may rise and fall in intensity , and those afflicted with\\nthe disorder may experience some periods of normal, non-\\ndepressed mood of up to two months in length. Its onset is\\ngradual, and dysthymic patients may not be able to pin-\\npoint exactly when they started feeling depressed. Individ-\\nuals with dysthymic disorder may experience a change in\\nsleeping and eating patterns, low self-esteem, fatigue, trou-\\nble concentrating, and feelings of hopelessness.\\nDepression also can occur in bipolar disorder ,a n\\naffective mental illness that causes radical emotional\\nchanges and mood swings, from manic highs to depres-\\nsive lows. The majority of bipolar individuals experience\\nalternating episodes of mania and depression.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe causes behind depression are complex and not\\nyet fully understood. While an imbalance of certain neu-\\nrotransmitters, the chemicals in the brain that transmit\\nmessages between nerve cells, is believed to be key to\\ndepression, external factors such as upbringing (more so\\nin dysthymia than major depression) may be as impor-\\ntant. For example, it is speculated that, if an individual is\\nabused and neglected throughout childhood and adoles-\\ncence, a pattern of low self-esteem and negative thinking\\nmay emerge, and from that, a lifelong pattern of depres-\\nsion may follow . A 2003 study reported that two-thirds\\nof patients with major depression say they also suffer\\nfrom chronic pain.\\nHeredity seems to play a role in who develops de-\\npression. Individuals with major depression in their im-\\nmediate family are up to three times more likely to have\\nthe disorder themselves. It would seem that biological\\nand genetic factors may make certain individuals predis-\\nposed or prone to depressive disorders, but environmen-\\ntal circumstances may often trigger the disorder.\\nExternal stressors and significant life changes, such\\nas chronic medical problems, death of a loved one, di-\\nvorce or estrangement, miscarriage, or loss of a job also\\ncan result in a form of depression known as adjustment\\ndisorder. Although periods of adjustment disorder usual-\\nly resolve themselves, occasionally they may evolve into\\na major depressive disorder.\\nMajor depressive episode\\nIndividuals experiencing a major depressive episode\\nhave a depressed mood and/or a diminished interest or\\npleasure in activities. Children experiencing a major de-\\npressive episode may appear or feel irritable, rather than\\ndepressed.

Treatment\\nconsists of exposure to light of a high intensity and/or\\nspecific spectra for an hour per day from a light box\\nplaced on the floor or on a table. The light intensity is\\nusually 10,000 lux which is similar to the light of a\\nsunny day . The opposite may be used, as well, which is\\nthe use of a dawn simulator for those patients who have\\nan overdose of light exposure and require more sleep\\nwith less light. Most persons will see an effect within\\nthree to four weeks. Side effects include headaches, eye-\\nstrain, irritability , and insomnia. A week or more in a\\nsunny climate may improve SAD.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nDepression usually is treated with antidepressants\\nand/or psychosocial therapy . When used together cor-\\nrectly , therapy and antidepressants are a powerful treat-\\nment plan for the depressed patient.\\nDrugs\\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),\\nsuch as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft), re-\\nduce depression by increasing levels of serotonin, a neu-\\nrotransmitter. Some clinicians prefer SSRIs for treatment\\nof dysthymic disorder. Anxiety , diarrhea , drowsiness,\\nheadache , sweating, nausea, poor sexual functioning,\\nand insomnia all are possible side effects of SSRIs. A re-\\ncent study shows this generation of drugs increases pa-\\ntients’ risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.\\nTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are less expensive\\nthan SSRIs, but have more severe side effects including\\npersistent dry mouth , sedation, dizziness , and cardiac\\narrhythmias. Because of these side effects, caution is\\ntaken when prescribing TCAs to elderly patients. TCAs\\ninclude amitriptyline (Elavil), imipramine (T ofranil), and\\nnortriptyline (A ventyl, Pamelor). A 10-day supply of\\nTCAs can be lethal if ingested all at once, so these drugs\\nmay not be a preferred treatment option for patients at\\nrisk for suicide.\\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors),\\nsuch as tranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenelzine\\n(Nardil), block the action of monoamine oxidase\\n(MAO), an enzyme in the central nervous system. Pa-\\ntients taking MAOIs must avoid foods high in tyramine\\n(found in aged cheeses and meats) to avoid potentially\\nserious hypertensive side effects.\\nHeterocyclics include bupropion (W ellbutrin) and\\ntrazodone (Desyrel). Bupropion is prescribed to patients\\nwith a seizure disorder. Side effects include agitation,\\nanxiety , confusion, tremor, dry mouth, fast or irregular\\nheartbeat, headache, low blood pressure, and insomnia.\\nBecause trazodone has a sedative effect, it is useful in\\ntreating depressed patients with insomnia. Other possible\\nside effects of trazodone include dry mouth, gastroin-\\ntestinal distress, dizziness, and headache. In 2003, W ell-\\nbutrin’s manufacturer released a once-daily version of\\nthe drug that offered low risk of sexual side effects or\\nweight gain.\\nElectroconvulsive therapy\\nECT , or electroconvulsive therapy , usually is em-\\nployed after all therapy and pharmaceutical treatment\\noptions have been explored and exhausted. However, it is\\nsometimes used early in treatment when severe depres-\\nsion is present and the patient refuses oral medication, or\\nwhen the patient is becoming dehydrated, extremely sui-\\ncidal, or psychotic.\\nThe treatment consists of a series of electrical pulses\\nthat move into the brain through electrodes on the pa-\\ntient’s head. ECT is given under general anesthesia and\\npatients are administered a muscle relaxant to prevent\\nconvulsions. Although the exact mechanisms behind the\\nsuccess of ECT therapy are not known, it is believed that\\nthe electrical current modifies the electrochemical\\nprocesses of the brain, consequently relieving depres-\\nsion. Headaches, muscle soreness, nausea, and confusion\\nare possible side effects immediately following an ECT\\nprocedure. Memory loss , typically transient, has also\\nbeen reported in ECT patients. ECT causes severe mem-\\nory problems for months or years in one out of every 200\\npatients treated.\\nLate in 2001, a study reported on a pacemaker-like\\ndevice used to treat epilepsy adapted for patients with de-\\npression. An implanted electronic device sends intermit-\\ntent signals to the vagus nerve, which in turn carries the\\nsignals to the brain, connecting in areas known to regu-\\nlate mood. Although still experimental at this time, early\\nresults in treating depression have been encouraging.\\nExpected results\\nUntreated or improperly treated depression is the\\nnumber one cause of suicide in the United States. Proper\\ntreatment relieves symptoms in 80–90% of depressed pa-\\ntients.

Odle\\nDermatitis\\nDefinition\\nDermatitis is a general term used to describe inflam-\\nmation of the skin.\\nDescription\\nMost types of dermatitis are characterized by a pink\\nor red rash that itches.\\nContact dermatitis is an allergic reaction to some-\\nthing that irritates the skin and is manifested by one or\\nmore lines of red, swollen, blistered skin that may itch or\\nweep. It usually appears within 48 hours after coming into\\ncontact with a substance to which the skin is sensitive.\\nThe condition is more common in adults than in children.\\nContact dermatitis can occur on any part of the body ,\\nbut it usually affects the hands, feet, and groin. Contact\\ndermatitis usually does not spread from one person to an-\\nother, nor does it spread beyond the area exposed to the\\nirritant unless affected skin comes into contact with an-\\nother part of the body . However, in the case of some irri-\\ntants, such as poison ivy , contact dermatitis can be passed\\nto another person or to another part of the body .\\nStasis dermatitis is characterized by scaly , greasy\\nlooking skin on the lower legs and around the ankles. Sta-\\nsis dermatitis is most apt to affect the inner side of the calf.\\nNummular dermatitis, which is also called nummu-\\nlar eczematous dermatitis or nummular eczema, general-\\nly affects the hands, arms, legs, and buttocks of men and\\nwomen older than 55 years of age. This stubborn, in-\\nflamed rash forms circular, sometimes itchy , patches and\\nis characterized by flares and periods of inactivity .\\nAtopic dermatitis is characterized by itching , scal-\\ning, swelling, and sometimes blistering. In early child-\\nhood it is called infantile eczema and is characterized by\\nredness, oozing, and crusting. It is usually found on the\\nface, inside the elbows, and behind the knees.\\nSeborrheic dermatitis may be dry or moist and is\\ncharacterized by greasy scales and yellowish crusts on the\\nscalp, eyelids, face, external surfaces of the ears, under-\\narms, breasts, and groin. In infants it is called cradle cap.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAllergic reactions are genetically determined, and\\ndifferent substances cause contact dermatitis to develop\\nin different people. A reaction to resin produced by poi-\\nson ivy , poison oak, or poison sumac is the most com-\\nmon source of symptoms. It is, in fact, the most common\\nallergy in this country , affecting one of every two people\\nin the United States.\\nFlowers, herbs, and vegetables can also affect the\\nskin of some people. Burns and sunburn increase the\\nrisk of dermatitis developing, and chemical irritants that\\ncan cause the condition include:\\n• chlorine\\n• cleansers\\n• detergents and soaps\\n• fabric softeners\\n• glues used on artificial nails\\n• perfumes\\n• topical medications\\nContact dermatitis can develop when the first con-\\ntact occurs or after years of use or exposure.\\nStasis dermatitis, a consequence of poor circulation,\\noccurs when leg veins can no longer return blood to the\\nheart as efficiently as they once did. When that happens,\\nfluid collects in the lower legs and causes them to swell.\\nStasis dermatitis can also result in a rash that can break\\ndown into sores known as stasis ulcers.\\nThe cause of nummular dermatitis is not known, but\\nit usually occurs in cold weather and is most common in\\npeople who have dry skin. Hot weather and stress can\\naggravate this condition, as can the following:\\n• allergies\\n• fabric softeners\\n• soaps and detergents\\n• wool clothing\\n• bathing more than once a day\\nAtopic dermatitis can be caused by allergies, asth-\\nma, or stress, and there seems to be a genetic predisposi-\\ntion for atopic conditions. It is sometimes caused by an\\nallergy to nickel in jewelry .\\nSeborrheic dermatitis (for which there may also be a\\ngenetic predisposition)is usually caused by overproduc-\\ntion of the oil glands.

In infants and adults it\\nmay be caused by a biotin or vitamin B deficiency .\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of dermatitis is made on the basis of\\nhow the rash looks and its location. The doctor may\\nscrape off a small piece of affected skin for microscopic\\nexamination or direct the patient to discontinue use of\\nany potential irritant that has recently come into contact\\nwith the affected area. T wo weeks after the rash disap-\\npears, the patient may resume use of the substances, one\\nat a time, until the condition recurs. Eliminating the sub-\\nstance most recently added should eliminate the irritation.\\nIf the origin of the irritation has still not been identi-\\nfied, a dermatologist may perform one or more patch tests.\\nThis involves dabbing a small amount of a suspected irri-\\ntant onto skin on the patient’s back. If no irritation devel-\\nops within a few days, another patch test is performed.\\nThe process continues until the patient experiences an al-\\nlergic reaction at the spot where the irritant was applied.\\nT reatment\\nHerbal treatments for dermatitis\\nSome herbal therapies can be useful for skin condi-\\ntions. Among the herbs most often recommended are:\\n• burdock root ( Arctium lappa)\\n• calendula ( Calendula officinalis) ointment\\n• chamomile ( Matricaria recutita) ointment\\n• cleavers ( Galium ssp.)\\n• evening primrose oil (Oenothera biennis)\\n• nettles ( Urtica dioica)\\nT reatments for contact dermatitis\\nContact dermatitis can be treated botanically and\\nhomeopathically . Specific homeopathic remedies are de-\\nsigned for individuals. Grindelia ( Grindelia spp.) and\\nsassafras (Sassafras albidum ) can help when applied\\ntopically . Determining the source of the problem and\\neliminating it is essential. Oatmeal baths are very helpful\\nin relieving the itch. Bentonite clay packs or any mud\\npack draws the fluid and helps dry up the lesions. Corti-\\nsone creams are not recommended by practitioners of\\nnatural medicine as they suppress the reaction rather\\nthan clear it.\\nT reatments for atopic dermatitis\\nNUTRITIONAL THERAPY . Because most cases of\\natopic dermatitis are caused by food allergy , the follow-\\ning dietary changes are often recommended:\\n• Identification and avoidance of allergenic foods. Foods\\nthat often cause allergy in infants include milk, eggs,\\npeanuts, tomatoes, seafoods, wheat, and soybean.\\n• Supplementing daily diet with vitamin A (5,000 U), vi-\\ntamin E (400 IU) and zinc (45-60 mg) or alternatively ,\\ntaking multivitamin-and-mineral supplement one tablet\\nonce daily .\\n• T aking fish oils supplements.

If the irritant cannot be avoided com-\\npletely , the patient should wear gloves and other protec-\\ntive clothing whenever exposure is likely to occur.\\nImmediately washing the exposed area with soap\\nand water can stem allergic reactions to poison ivy , poi-\\nson oak, or poison sumac, but because soaps can dry the\\nskin, patients susceptible to dermatitis should use them\\nonly on the face, feet, genitals and underarms.\\nClothing should be loose fitting and 100% cotton.\\nNew clothing should be washed in dye-free, unscented\\ndetergent before being worn.\\nInjury to the lower leg can cause stasis dermatitis to\\nulcerate (form open sores).

It is based\\non the principle that illnesses can be caused by the accu-\\nmulation of toxic substances (toxins) in the body . Elimi-\\nnating existing toxins and avoiding new toxins are essen-\\ntial parts of the healing process. Detoxification utilizes a\\nvariety of tests and techniques.\\nOrigins\\nDetoxification methods of healing have been used\\nfor thousands of years. Fasting , a method used often in\\ndetoxification treatments, is one of the oldest therapeutic\\npractices in medicine. Hippocrates, the ancient Greek\\nknown as the father of W estern medicine, recommended\\nfasting as a means for improving health. A yurvedic med-\\nicine, a traditional healing system that has developed over\\nthousands of years, utilizes detoxification methods to\\ntreat many chronic conditions and to prevent illness.\\nDetoxification treatment has become one of the cor-\\nnerstones of alternative medicine. Conventional medi-\\ncine notes that environmental factors can play a signifi-\\ncant role in many illnesses. Environmental medicine is a\\nfield that studies exactly how those environmental fac-\\ntors influence disease. Conditions such as asthma, can-\\ncer, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sen-\\nsitivity , and many others are strongly influenced by ex-\\nposure to toxic or allergenic substances in the environ-\\nment. The United States Centers for Disease Control\\nestimate that over 80% of all illnesses have environmen-\\ntal and lifestyle causes.\\nDetoxification has also become a prominent treatment\\nas people have become more aware of environmental pol-\\nlution. It is estimated that one in every four Americans suf-\\nfers from some level of heavy metal poisoning . Heavy\\nmetals, such as lead, mercury , cadmium, and arsenic, are\\nby-products of industry . Synthetic agriculture chemicals,\\nmany of which are known to cause health problems, are\\nalso found in food, air, and water. American agriculture\\nuses nearly 10 pounds of pesticides per person on the food\\nsupply each year. These toxins have become almost un-\\navoidable. Pesticides that are used only on crops in the\\nsouthern United States have been found in the tissue of ani-\\nmals in the far north of Canada. DDT , a cancer-causing in-\\nsecticide that has been banned for decades, is still regularly\\nfound in the fatty tissue of animals, birds, and fish, even in\\nextremely remote regions such as the North Pole.\\nThe problem of toxins in the environment is com-\\npounded because humans are at the top of the food chain\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nEditors of Time-Life Books.

Drugs and alcohol have toxic effects in the body .\\nT oxins are produced as normal by-products in the in-\\ntestines by the bacteria that break down food. The diges-\\ntion of protein also creates toxic by-products in the body .\\nThe body has natural methods of detoxification. In-\\ndividual cells get detoxified in the lymph and circulatory\\nsystems. The liver is the principle organ of detoxifica-\\ntion, assisted by the kidneys and intestines. T oxins can\\nbe excreted from the body by the kidneys, bowels, skin,\\nand lungs. Detoxification treatments become necessary\\nwhen the body’s natural detoxification systems become\\noverwhelmed. This can be caused by long-term effects of\\nimproper diet, stress, overeating, sedentary lifestyles, ill-\\nness, and poor health habits in general. When a build up\\nof toxic substances in the body creates illness, it’s called\\ntoxemia. Some people’s digestive tracts become unable\\nto digest food properly , due to years of overeating and\\ndiets that are high in fat and processed foods and low in\\nfiber (the average American diet). When this happens,\\nfood cannot pass through the digestive tract efficiently .\\nInstead of being digested properly or eliminated from the\\nbowel, food can literally rot inside the digestive tract and\\nproduce toxic by-products. This state is known as toxic\\ncolon syndrome or intestinal toxemia.\\nDetoxification therapies try to activate and assist the\\nbody’s own detoxification processes. They also try to\\neliminate additional exposure to toxins and to strengthen\\nthe body and immune system so that toxic imbalances\\nwon’t occur in the future.\\nT esting for toxic substances\\nDetoxification specialists use a variety of tests to de-\\ntermine the causes contributing to toxic conditions.\\nThese causes include infections, allergies, addictions,\\ntoxic chemicals, and digestive and organ dysfunction.\\nBlood, urine, stool, and hair analyses, as well as allergy\\ntests, are used to measure a variety of bodily functions\\nthat may indicate problems. Detoxification therapists\\nusually have access to laboratories that specialize in so-\\nphisticated diagnostic tests for toxic conditions.\\nPeople who have toxemia are often susceptible to\\ninfection because their immune systems are weakened.\\nInfections can be caused by parasites, bacteria, viruses,\\nand a common yeast. Therapists will screen patients for\\nunderlying infections that may be contributing to illness.\\nLiver function is studied closely with blood and\\nurine tests because the liver is the principle organ in the\\nbody responsible for removing toxic compounds. When\\nthe liver detoxifies a substance from the body , it does so\\nin two phases. T ests are performed that indicate where\\nproblems may be occurring in these phases, which may\\npoint to specific types of toxins. Blood and urine tests\\ncan also be completed that screen for toxic chemicals\\nsuch as PCBs (environmental poisons), formaldehyde (a\\ncommon preservative), pesticides, and heavy metals. An-\\nother useful blood test is a test for zinc deficiency , which\\nmay reveal heavy metal poisoning. Hair analysis is used\\nto test for heavy metal levels in the body . Blood and\\nurine tests check immune system activity , and hormone\\nlevels can also indicate specific toxic compounds. A 24-\\nhour urine analysis, where samples are taken around the\\nclock, allows therapists to determine the efficiency of the\\ndigestive tract and kidneys. T ogether with stool analysis,\\nthese tests may indicate toxic bowel syndrome and di-\\ngestive system disorders. Certain blood and urine tests\\nmay point to nutritional deficiencies and proper recovery\\ndiets can be designed for patients as well.\\nDetoxification therapists may also perform exten-\\nsive allergy and hypersensitivity tests. Intradermal (be-\\ntween layers of the skin) and sublingual (under the\\ntongue) allergy tests are used to determine a patient’s\\nsensitivity to a variety of common substances, including\\nformaldehyde, auto exhaust, perfume, tobacco, chlorine,\\njet fuel, and other chemicals.\\nFood allergies require additional tests because these\\nallergies often cause reactions that are delayed for several\\ndays after the food is eaten. The RAST (radioallergosor-\\nbent test) is a blood test that determines the level of anti-\\nbodies (immunoglobulins) in the blood after specific\\nfoods are eaten. The cytotoxic test is a blood test that de-\\ntermines if certain substances affect blood cells, includ-\\ning foods and chemicals. The ELISA-ACT (enzyme-\\nlinked immunoserological assay activated cell test) is\\nconsidered to be one of the most accurate tests for aller-\\ngies and hypersensitivity to foods, chemicals, and other\\nagents. Other tests for food allergies are the elimination\\nand rotation diets, in which foods are systematically eval-\\nuated to determine the ones that are causing problems.\\nDetoxification therapists usually interview and\\ncounsel patients closely to determine and correct\\nlifestyle, occupational, psychological, and emotional\\nfactors that may also be contributing to illness.\\nDetoxification therapies\\nDetoxification therapists use a variety of healing\\ntechniques after a diagnosis is made.

If mercury poisoning has been determined, the pa-\\ntient will be advised to have mercury fillings from the\\nteeth removed, preferably by a holistic dentist.\\nSpecific treatments are used to stimulate and assist\\nthe body’s detoxification process. Dietary change is im-\\nmediately enacted, eliminating allergic and unhealthy\\nfoods, and emphasizing foods that assist detoxification\\nand support healing. Detoxification diets are generally\\nlow in fat, high in fiber, and vegetarian with a raw food\\nemphasis. Processed foods, alcohol, and caffeine are\\navoided. Nutritional supplements such as vitamins, min-\\nerals, antioxidants , amino acids , and essential fatty\\nacids are often prescribed. Spirulina is a sea algae that\\nis frequently given to assist in eliminating heavy metals.\\nLipotropic agents are certain vitamins and nutrients that\\npromote the flow of bile and fat from the liver.\\nMany herbal supplements are used in detoxification\\ntherapies as well. Milk thistle extract, called silymarin,\\nis one of the more potent herbs for detoxifying the liver.\\nNaturopathy , A yurvedic medicine, and traditional Chi-\\nnese medicine (TCM) recommend numerous herbal for-\\nmulas for detoxification and immune strengthening. If\\ninfections or parasites have been found, these are treated\\nwith herbal formulas and antibiotics in difficult cases.\\nFor toxic bowel syndrome and digestive tract disor-\\nders, herbal laxatives and high fiber foods such as psyllium\\nseeds may be given to cleanse the digestive tract and pro-\\nmote elimination. Colonics are used to cleanse the lower in-\\ntestines. Digestive enzymes are prescribed to improve di-\\ngestion, and acidophilus and other friendly bacteria are\\nreintroduced into the system with nutritional supplements.\\nFasting is another major therapy in detoxification.\\nFasting is one of the quickest ways to promote the elimina-\\ntion of stored toxins in the body and to prompt the healing\\nprocess. People with severe toxic conditions are supervised\\nclosely during fasting because the number of toxins in the\\nbody temporarily increases as they are being released.\\nChelation therapy is used by detoxification special-\\nists to rid the body of heavy metals. Chelates are particu-\\nlar substances that bind to heavy metals and speed their\\nelimination. In 2002, a new five-year clinical trial was\\nfunded to explore the use of chelation therapy in patients\\nwith heart disease. Homeopathic remedies have also been\\nshown to be effective for removing heavy metals.\\nSweating therapies can also detoxify the body be-\\ncause the skin is a major organ of elimination. Sweating\\nhelps release those toxins that are stored in the subcuta-\\nneous (under the skin) fat cells. Saunas, therapeutic\\nbaths, and exercise are some of these treatments. Body\\ntherapies may also be prescribed, including massage\\ntherapy, acupressure, shiatsu, manual lymph drainage,\\nand polarity therapy . These body therapies seek to im-\\nprove circulatory and structural problems, reduce stress,\\nand promote healing responses in the body . Mind/body\\ntherapies such as psychotherapy, counseling, and stress\\nmanagement techniques may be used to heal the psycho-\\nlogical components of illness and to help patients over-\\ncome their negative patterns contributing to illness.\\nPractitioners and treatment costs\\nThe costs of detoxification therapies can vary wide-\\nly , depending on the number of tests and treatments re-\\nquired. Detoxification treatments can be lengthy and in-\\nvolved since illnesses associated with toxic conditions\\nusually develop over many years and may not clear up\\nquickly . Detoxification treatments may be lengthy be-\\ncause they often strive for the holistic healing of the\\nbody , mind, and emotions.\\nPractitioners may be conventionally trained medical\\ndoctors with specialties in environmental medicine or in-\\nterests in alternative treatment. The majority of detoxifi-\\ncation therapists are alternative practitioners, such as\\nnaturopaths, homeopaths, ayurvedic doctors, or tradi-\\ntional Chinese doctors. Insurance coverage varies, de-\\npending on the practitioner and the treatment involved.\\nConsumers should review their individual insurance\\npolicies regarding treatment coverage.\\nPreparations\\nPatients can assist diagnosis and treatment by keep-\\ning detailed diaries of their activities, symptoms, and\\ncontact with environmental factors that may be affecting\\ntheir health.

The\\nplant grows in an arid climate and is found in Namibia,\\nMadagascar, the Kalahari Desert, and other areas on the\\nAfrican continent. The tuberous roots are used in tradi-\\ntional medicine. The root is collected when the rainy sea-\\nson ends. The root is chopped and dried in the sun for\\nthree days. Devil’s claw is also known as grapple plant\\nand wood spider.\\nGeneral use\\nDevil’s claw has been used for numerous conditions\\nin several areas of the world. In South Africa, the root\\nand tuber have been used for centuries as an all-purpose\\nfolk remedy . Devil’s claw has been used to reduce fever\\nand pain, to treat allergies and headache, and to stimu-\\nlate digestion. Traditional healers also used devil’s claw\\nto treat inflammatory conditions such as arthritis,\\nrheumatism, and lower back pain. Devil’s claw has also\\nbeen used as a remedy for liver and kidney disorders.\\nDevil’s claw root was also used in folk medicine as\\na pain reliever and for complications with pregnancies.\\nIn addition, an ointment made from devil’s claw was\\nused for skin injuries and disorders.\\nEuropean colonists brought the African plant back\\nto their continent where it was used to treat arthritis. In\\nthe United States, use of devil’s claw dates back to the\\ntreatment is scarcely mentioned by the medical estab-\\nlishment. The research that exists on detoxification is\\nlargely testimonial, consisting of individual personal ac-\\ncounts of healing without statistics or controlled scientif-\\nic experiments.

The slaves brought herbs and herbal\\nknowledge with them to the new continent.\\nDevil’s claw has been used as an herbal remedy in\\nEurope for a long time. Current uses for devil’s claw are\\nmuch the same as they were centuries ago. In Europe,\\nthe herb is still a remedy for arthritis and other types of\\njoint pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,\\nand gout (a painful joint inflammation disease).\\nDevil’s claw is also used for soft tissue conditions\\nwith inflammation, like tendinitis and bursitis. The bit-\\nter herb is also used as a remedy for loss of appetite and\\nmildly upset stomach.\\nThe herb is currently used for other conditions such\\nas problems with pregnancy , menstruation , and\\nmenopause . Devil’s claw is also regarded as a remedy\\nfor headaches, heartburn , liver and gallbladder prob-\\nlems, allergies, skin disorders, and nicotine poisoning.\\nEuropean research during the late 1990s indicated\\nthat devil’s claw relieved arthritis and joint pain condi-\\ntions. The herb also helped with soft muscle pain such as\\ntendinitis. However, there is no evidence that proves\\ndevil’s claw is an effective remedy for other conditions\\nsuch as difficulties during pregnancy and skin disorders.\\nPreparations\\nSeveral forms of devil’s claw are used. In Europe,\\ndoctors treat some conditions like arthritis with an injec-\\ntion of devil’s claw extract. The herb is taken internally\\nas a tea or in capsule form. When taken for pain relief,\\ndevil’s claw must be taken regularly for up to one month\\nbefore results are seen. An ointment form of devil’s claw\\ncan be applied to the skin to treat wounds or scars.\\nHerbal tea and tincture\\nDevil’s claw tea is prepared by pouring 1.25 cups\\n(300 ml) boiling water over 1 tsp (4.5 g) of the herb. The\\nmixture, which is also called an infusion, is steeped for\\neight hours and then strained. The daily dosage is 3 cups\\nof warm tea.\\nFor most conditions, the average daily dosage is 1\\ntsp (4.5 g) of devil’s claw herb. However, the amount is\\nreduced to 1/3 tsp (1.5 g) when devil’s claw is taken for\\nappetite loss.\\nIn a tincture, the herb is preserved with alcohol. The\\ntincture steeps for two weeks and is shaken daily . It is\\nthen strained and bottled. When devil’s claw tincture is\\nused as a remedy , the dosage is 1 tsp (4.5 g) taken three\\ntimes per day for a specified period.\\nT ea and tincture should be consumed 30 minutes be-\\nfore eating. This allows for better absorption of the herb.\\nDevil’s claw capsules\\nThe anti-inflammatory properties of devil’s claw are\\nattributed to two constituents, harpagoside and beta\\nsitoserol. If a person takes devil’s claw capsules or\\ntablets as a remedy , attention should be paid to the\\nharpagoside content. The daily amount of harpagoside in\\ncapsules should total 50 mg.\\nCombinations\\nFor arthritis treatment, devil’s claw can be combined\\nwith anti-inflammatory or cleansing herbs. In addition,\\ndevil’s claw can be combined with bogbean or mead-\\nowsweet. An herbalist, naturopathic doctor, or traditional\\nhealer can provide more information on herb combina-\\ntions appropriate for a specific condition.\\nPrecautions\\nDevil’s claw is safe to use when proper dosage rec-\\nommendations are followed, according to sources in-\\ncluding the PDR (Physician’s Desk Reference) for\\nHerbal Medicines , the 1998 book based on the 1997\\nfindings of Germany’s Commission E.\\nAlthough devil’s claw has not undergone the FDA\\nresearch required for approval as a remedy , other stud-\\nies in Europe confirm that devil’s claw is safe for most\\npeople. However, people with ulcers should be cau-\\ntious because the herb stimulates the production of\\nstomach acid.\\nFurthermore, it is not known if devil’s claw is safe\\nfor people with major liver or kidney conditions. In addi-\\ntion, devil’s claw could cause an allergic reaction.\\nThere is some debate in the alternative medicine\\ncommunity about whether pregnant women can use\\ndevil’s claw as a remedy . Some researchers say that the\\nherb is safe to use; others say that not enough research\\nhas been done to prove that the herb is safe for pregnant\\nwomen. There appears to be no scientific proof that\\nusing devil’s claw could result in miscarriages.\\nSide effects\\nDevil’s claw could cause an allergic reaction or mild\\ngastrointestinal difficulties.\\nInteractions\\nNo interactions between other medications and\\ndevil’s claw have been reported according to the PDR for\\nHerbal Medicines .

It is a precursor to\\nthe male sex hormone testosterone. It is also sold as an\\nover-the-counter dietary supplement.\\nThe human body produces very little DHEA until\\nabout the age of seven, when production soars. It peaks\\nin the mid-20s and starts to decline in the early 30s. By\\nthe mid-70s, DHEA production has dropped by about\\n80-90%. At all ages, DHEA levels are slightly higher in\\nmen than women. The optimum DHEA level in a healthy\\nadult is 750-1,250 milligrams per deciliter of blood\\n(mg/dL) for men and 550-980 mg/dL for women.\\nDHEA was first identified in 1934 and was sold\\nover the counter mainly as a weight loss aid until the late\\n1980s. Then the federal Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) classified DHEA as a drug, making it available by\\nprescription only . The FDA reversed itself in 1994, re-\\nclassifying DHEA as a dietary supplement obtainable\\nwithout a prescription.\\nA 1994 study by researchers at the University of Cal-\\nifornia, San Diego looked at 30 middle-age men and\\nwomen who took 50 mg of DHEA a day for three\\nmonths. The test subjects generally reported an improved\\nsense of well-being, increased energy , enhanced sex\\ndrive, and an improved ability to deal with stress. The re-\\nsults were widely reported by the mass media, with sever-\\nal referring to DHEA as the “fountain of youth hormone. ”\\nDespite hundreds of studies of DHEA over the past\\nthree decades, researchers are still unclear on how the\\nhormone works or exactly what it does in the body . Al-\\nthough it is know DHEA decreases with age, it is not\\nknown whether this constitutes a deficiency or is because\\nthe body needs less DHEA as it ages.\\nThe main reason so little is known about DHEA is\\nbecause the hormone is not patentable, so drug companies\\nare unwilling to spend money doing further research on it.\\nMuch of the research today in funded through universities\\nand the National Institute on Aging that maintains a skep-\\ntical philosophy about DHEA supplementation.\\nGeneral use\\nOriginally marketed as a weight loss supplement,\\nDHEA is now promoted as being beneficial for treating a\\nwide variety of medical conditions, including cancer,\\nheart disease, Alzheimer’s, and AIDS. It is also purported\\nto have anti-aging qualities. Studies in rodents and test\\ntubes have shown daily doses of DHEA can prevent or\\nbenefit such conditions as cancer, heart disease,osteoporo-\\nsis, diabetes, lupus,obesity, and viral infections. Far fewer\\nlong-term studies have been done in humans and the re-\\nsults are often conflicting. In general, DHEA supplementa-\\ntion seems to be more beneficial to men than women.\\nProponents of DHEA also say the hormone has anti-\\naging properties that can slow the aging process and lead\\nto longer life. In his book, The DHEA Breakthrough:\\nLook Y ounger , Live Longer , F eel Better , biochemist\\nStephen Cherniske, states that DHEA supplementation\\nalong with proper diet, vitamins, and exercise , can pro-\\nlong life. “ After all, the human body is designed to last\\nabout 120 years, and with proper care they can all be vi-\\nbrantly healthy years. What DHEA provides is the miss-\\ning link in your longevity program.

W ells\\nDiabetes mellitus\\nDefinition\\nDiabetes mellitus is a condition in which the pan-\\ncreas no longer produces enough insulin or when cells\\nstop responding to the insulin that is produced, so that\\nglucose in the blood cannot be absorbed into the cells of\\nthe body . Symptoms include frequent urination, tired-\\nness, excessive thirst, and hunger.\\nDescription\\nDiabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that causes se-\\nrious health complications including renal (kidney) fail-\\nure, heart disease , stroke, and blindness. Approximate-\\nly 14 million Americans (about 5% of the population)\\nhave diabetes. Unfortunately , as many as one-half of\\nthem are unaware that they have it.\\nBackground\\nEvery cell in the human body needs energy in order\\nto function. The body’s primary energy source is glu-\\ncose, a simple sugar resulting from the digestion of\\nfoods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches).\\nGlucose from the digested food circulates in the blood as\\na ready energy source for cells. Insulin is a hormone or\\nchemical produced by cells in the pancreas, an organ lo-\\ncated behind the stomach. Insulin binds to receptor sites\\non the outside of cells and acts like a key to open a door-\\nway into the cell through which glucose can enter. Some\\nof the glucose can be converted to concentrated energy\\nsources like glycogen or fatty acids and saved for later\\nuse. When there is not enough insulin produced or when\\nthe doorway no longer recognizes the insulin key , glu-\\ncose stays in the blood instead of entering the cells.\\nThe body will attempt to dilute the high level of glu-\\ncose in the blood, a condition called hyperglycemia, by\\ndrawing water out of the cells and into the bloodstream.\\nThe excess sugar is excreted in the urine. It is not unusu-\\nal for people with undiagnosed diabetes to be constantly\\nthirsty , to drink large quantities of water, and to urinate\\nfrequently as their bodies try to get rid of the extra glu-\\ncose. This creates high levels of glucose in the urine.\\nAt the same time that the body is trying to get rid of\\nglucose from the blood, the cells are starving for glucose\\nand sending signals to the body to eat more food, thus\\nmaking patients extremely hungry . T o provide energy for\\nthe starving cells, the body also tries to convert fats and\\nproteins to glucose. The breakdown of fats and proteins\\nfor energy causes acid compounds called ketones to\\nform in the blood. Ketones also will be excreted in the\\nurine. As ketones build up in the blood, a condition\\ncalled ketoacidosis can occur. If left untreated, ketoaci-\\ndosis can lead to coma and death.\\nT ypes of diabetes mellitus\\nT ype I diabetes, sometimes called juvenile diabetes,\\nbegins most commonly in childhood or adolescence. In\\nthis form of diabetes, the body produces little or no in-\\nsulin. It is characterized by a sudden onset and occurs\\nmore frequently in populations descended from northern\\nEuropean countries (Finland, Scotland, Scandinavia)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 617\\nDiabetes mellitus\\nExcessive thirst\\nIncreased appetite\\nIncreased urination\\nWeight loss \\nFatigue\\nNausea\\nBlurred vision\\nFrequent vaginal infections in women\\nImpotence in men\\nFrequent yeast infections\\nSYMPTOMS OF DIABETES MELLITUS\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:23 PM  Page 617'),\n",

(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by\\npermission.)\\nthan in those from southern European countries, the\\nMiddle East, or Asia. In the United States, approximate-\\nly 3 people in 1,000 develop T ype I diabetes. This form\\nalso is called insulin-dependent diabetes because people\\nwho develop this type need to have injections of insulin\\n1–2 times per day .\\nBrittle diabetics are a subgroup of T ype I where pa-\\ntients have frequent and rapid swings of blood sugar lev-\\nels between hyperglycemia (a condition where there is\\ntoo much glucose or sugar in the blood) and hypo-\\nglycemia (a condition where there are abnormally low\\nlevels of glucose or sugar in the blood). These patients\\nmay require several injections of different types of in-\\nsulin or an insulin pump during the day to keep their\\nblood sugar within a fairly normal range.\\nThe more common form of diabetes, T ype II, occurs\\nin approximately 3–5% of Americans under 50 years of\\nage, and increases to 10–15% in those over 50. More\\nthan 90% of the diabetics in the United States are T ype II\\ndiabetics. In 2003, a report noted that nearly one-third of\\nthe U.S. population over age 20 has this form of diabetes\\nbut remains undiagnosed. Sometimes called age-onset or\\nadult-onset diabetes, this form of diabetes occurs most\\noften in people who are overweight and do not exercise.\\nIt also is more common in people of Native American,\\nHispanic, and African-American descent. People who\\nhave migrated to W estern cultures from East India,\\nJapan, and Australian Aboriginal cultures are also more\\nlikely to develop T ype II diabetes than those who remain\\nin their original countries.\\nT ype II is considered a milder form of diabetes be-\\ncause of its slow onset (sometimes developing over the\\ncourse of several years) and because it can usually be con-\\ntrolled with diet and oral medication. The consequences of\\nuncontrolled and untreated T ype II diabetes, however, are\\njust as serious as those for T ype I. This form also is called\\nnoninsulin-dependent diabetes, a term that is somewhat\\nmisleading. Many people with T ype II diabetes can con-\\ntrol the condition with diet and oral medications, however,\\ninsulin injections sometimes are necessary .\\nAnother form of diabetes, called gestational dia-\\nbetes, can develop during pregnancy and generally re-\\nsolves after the baby is delivered. This diabetic condition\\ndevelops during the second or third trimester of pregnan-\\ncy in about 2% of pregnancies. The condition usually is\\ntreated by diet, however, insulin injections may be re-\\nquired. W omen who have diabetes during pregnancy are\\nat higher risk for developing T ype II diabetes within\\n5–10 years.\\nDiabetes also can develop as a result of pancreatic\\ndisease, alcoholism , malnutrition, or other severe ill-\\nnesses that stress the body .\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe causes of diabetes mellitus are unclear, howev-\\ner, there seem to be both hereditary (genetic factors\\npassed on in families) and environmental factors in-\\nvolved. Research has shown that some people who de-\\nvelop diabetes have common genetic markers. In T ype I\\ndiabetes, an autoimmune response is believed to be trig-\\ngered by a virus or another microorganism that destroys\\nthe cells that produce insulin. In T ype II diabetes, age,\\nobesity, and family history of diabetes play a role.\\nIn T ype II diabetes, the pancreas may produce\\nenough insulin, however, cells have become resistant to\\nthe insulin produced and it may not work as effectively .\\nSymptoms of T ype II diabetes can begin so gradually\\nthat a person may not know that he or she has it. Early\\nsigns are tiredness, extreme thirst, and frequent urina-\\ntion. Other symptoms may include sudden weight loss,\\nslow wound healing, urinary tract infections, gum dis-\\nease, or blurred vision. It is not unusual for T ype II dia-\\nbetes to be detected while a patient is seeing a doctor\\nabout a health concern that was caused by the yet undi-\\nagnosed diabetes.\\nIndividuals who are at high risk of developing T ype\\nII diabetes mellitus include people who:\\n• are obese (more than 20% above their ideal body\\nweight)\\n• have a relative with diabetes mellitus\\n• belong to a high-risk ethnic population (African-Amer-\\nican, Native American, Hispanic, or Native Hawaiian)\\n• have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes or have\\ndelivered a baby weighing more than 9 lb (4 kg)\\n• have high blood pressure (140/90 mmHg or above)\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:23 PM  Page 619'),\n",

Several drugs\\nthat are used to treat mood disorders (such as anxiety and\\ndepression ) also can impair glucose absorption. These\\ndrugs include haloperidol, lithium carbonate, phenoth-\\niazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and adrenergic agonists.\\nOther medications that can cause diabetes symptoms in-\\nclude isoniazid, nicotinic acid, cimetidine, and heparin.\\nSymptoms of diabetes can develop suddenly (over\\ndays or weeks) in previously healthy children or adoles-\\ncents, or can develop gradually (over several years) in\\noverweight adults over the age of 40. The classic symp-\\ntoms include feeling tired and sick, frequent urination,\\nexcessive thirst, excessive hunger, and weight loss.\\nKetoacidosis, a condition due to starvation or un-\\ncontrolled diabetes, is common in T ype I diabetes. Ke-\\ntones are acid compounds that form in the blood when\\nthe body breaks down fats and proteins. Symptoms in-\\nclude abdominal pain , vomiting , rapid breathing, ex-\\ntreme tiredness, and drowsiness. Patients with ketoacido-\\nsis will also have a sweet breath odor. Left untreated, this\\ncondition can lead to coma and death.\\nWith T ype II diabetes, the condition may not become\\nevident until the patient presents for medical treatment\\nfor some other condition. A patient may have heart dis-\\nease, chronic infections of the gums and urinary tract,\\nblurred vision, numbness in the feet and legs, or slow-\\nhealing wounds. W omen may experience genital itching.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiabetes is suspected based on symptoms. Urine tests\\nand blood tests can be used to confirm a diagnosis of dia-\\nbetes based on the amount of glucose in the urine and blood.\\nUrine tests also can detect ketones and protein in the urine\\nwhich may help diagnose diabetes and assess how well the\\nkidneys are functioning. These tests also can be used to\\nmonitor the disease once the patient is under treatment.\\nUrine tests\\nClinistix and Diastix are paper strips or dipsticks\\nthat change color when dipped in urine. The test strip is\\ncompared to a chart that shows the amount of glucose in\\nthe urine based on the change in color. The level of glu-\\ncose in the urine lags behind the level of glucose in the\\nblood. T esting the urine with a test stick, paper strip, or\\ntablet is not as accurate as blood testing, however it can\\ngive a fast and simple reading.\\nKetones in the urine can be detected using similar\\ntypes of dipstick tests (Acetest or Ketostix). Ketoacidosis\\ncan be a life-threatening situation in T ype I diabetics, so\\nhaving a quick and simple test to detect ketones can as-\\nsist in establishing a diagnosis sooner.\\nAnother dipstick test can determine the presence of\\nprotein or albumin in the urine. Protein in the urine can in-\\ndicate problems with kidney function and can be used to\\ntrack the development of renal failure. A more sensitive\\ntest for urine protein uses radioactively tagged chemicals\\nto detect microalbuminuria, small amounts of protein in\\nthe urine, which may not show up on dipstick tests.\\nBlood tests\\nFasting glucose test. Blood is drawn from a vein in\\nthe patient’s arm after the patient has not eaten for at\\nleast eight hours, usually in the morning before break-\\nfast. The red blood cells are separated from the sample\\nand the amount of glucose is measured in the remaining\\nplasma. A plasma level of 7.8 mmol/L (200 mg/L) or\\ngreater can indicate diabetes. The fasting glucose test is\\nusually repeated on another day to confirm the results.\\nPostprandial glucose test. Blood is taken right after\\nthe patient has eaten a meal.\\nOral glucose tolerance test. Blood samples are taken\\nfrom a vein before and after a patient drinks a sweet\\nsyrup of glucose and other sugars. In a non-diabetic, the\\nlevel of glucose in the blood goes up immediately after\\nthe drink and then decreases gradually as insulin is used\\nby the body to metabolize, or absorb, the sugar. In a dia-\\nbetic, the glucose in the blood goes up and stays high\\nafter drinking the sweetened liquid. A plasma glucose\\nlevel of 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) or higher at two hours\\nafter drinking the syrup and at one other point during the\\ntwo-hour test period confirms the diagnosis of diabetes.\\nA diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed if a plasma glu-\\ncose level of at least 11.1 mmol/L, a fasting plasma glu-\\ncose level of at least 7 mmol/L; or a two-hour plasma\\nglucose level of at least 11.1 mmol/L during an oral glu-\\ncose tolerance test.\\nIn 2002, scientists announced that a new simple blood\\ntest to screen for diabetes had been developed.

A small needle\\nor lancet is used to prick the finger and a drop of blood is\\ncollected and analyzed by a monitoring device. Some pa-\\ntients may test their blood glucose levels several times\\nduring a day and use this information to adjust their diet\\nor doses of insulin.\\nT reatment\\nThere is currently no cure for diabetes. Diet, exer-\\ncise, and careful monitoring of blood glucose levels are\\nthe keys to manage diabetes so that patients can live a\\nrelatively normal life. Diabetes can be life-threatening if\\nnot properly managed, so patients should not attempt to\\ntreat this condition without medical supervision. Treat-\\nment of diabetes focuses on two goals: keeping blood\\nglucose within normal range and preventing the develop-\\nment of long-term complications. Alternative treatments\\ncannot replace the need for insulin but they may enhance\\ninsulin’s effectiveness and may lower blood glucose lev-\\nels. In addition, alternative medicines may help to treat\\ncomplications of the disease and improve quality of life.\\nDiet\\nDiet and moderate exercise are the first treatments\\nimplemented in diabetes. For many T ype II diabetics,\\nweight loss may be an important goal to help them to\\ncontrol their diabetes. A well-balanced, nutritious diet\\nprovides approximately 50–60% of calories from carbo-\\nhydrates, approximately 10–20% of calories from pro-\\ntein, and less than 30% of calories from fat. The number\\nof calories required depends on the patient’s age, weight,\\nand activity level. The calorie intake also needs to be dis-\\ntributed over the course of the entire day so surges of glu-\\ncose entering the blood system are kept to a minimum. In\\n2002, a Korean study demonstrated that eating a combi-\\nnation of whole grains and legume powder was beneficial\\nin lowering blood glucose levels in men with diabetes.\\nKeeping track of the number of calories provided by\\ndifferent foods can be complicated, so patients are usual-\\nly advised to consult a nutritionist or dietitian. An indi-\\nvidualized, easy-to-manage diet plan can be set up for\\neach patient. Both the American Diabetes Association\\nand the American Dietetic Association recommend diets\\nbased on the use of food exchange lists. Each food ex-\\nchange contains a known amount of calories in the form\\nof protein, fat, or carbohydrate. A patient’s diet plan will\\nconsist of a certain number of exchanges from each food\\ncategory (meat or protein, fruits, breads and starches,\\nvegetables, and fats) to be eaten at meal times and as\\nsnacks. Patients have flexibility in choosing the foods\\nthey eat as long as they don’t exceed the number of ex-\\nchanges prescribed. The food exchange system, along\\nwith a plan of moderate exercise, can help diabetics lose\\nexcess weight and improve their overall health. Certain\\nfoods will be emphasized over others to promote a\\nhealthy heart as well.\\nSupplements\\nCHROMIUM PICOLINATE. Several studies have had\\nconflicting results on the effectiveness of chromium pi-\\ncolinate supplementation for control of blood glucose\\nlevels. In one study , approximately 70% of the diabetics\\nreceiving 200 micrograms of chromium picolinate daily\\nreduced their need for insulin and medications. While\\nsome studies have shown that supplementation caused\\nsignificant weight loss, and decreases in blood glucose\\nand serum triglycerides, others have shown no benefit.\\nChromium supplementation may cause hypoglycemia\\nand other side effects.\\nMAGNESIUM. Magnesium deficiency may interfere\\nwith insulin secretion and uptake and worsen the pa-\\ntient’s control of blood sugar. Also, magnesium deficien-\\ncy puts diabetics at risk for certain complications, espe-\\ncially retinopathy and cardiovascular disease.\\nVANADIUM. V anadium has been shown to bring\\nblood glucose to normal levels in diabetic animals.

Biofeedback can have significant effects on dia-\\nbetes including improved glucose tolerance and decreased\\nblood glucose levels. In addition, biofeedback can be used\\nto treat diabetic complications and improve quality of life.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nTraditional treatment of diabetes begins with a well\\nbalanced diet and moderate exercise. Medications are\\nprescribed only if the patient’s blood glucose cannot be\\ncontrolled by these methods.\\nOral medications\\nOral medications are available to lower blood glucose\\nin T ype II diabetics. Drugs first prescribed for T ype II dia-\\nbetes are in a class of compounds called sulfonylureas and\\ninclude tolbutamide, tolazamide, acetohexamide, chlor-\\npropamide, glyburide, glimeperide, and glipizide. The way\\nthat these drugs work is not well understood, however, they\\nseem to stimulate cells of the pancreas to produce more in-\\nsulin. New medications that are available to treat diabetes in-\\nclude metformin, acarbose, and troglitizone. These medica-\\ntions are not a substitute for a well planned diet and moder-\\nate exercise. Oral medications are not effective for T ype I di-\\nabetes, in which the patient produces little or no insulin.\\nInsulin\\nPatients with T ype I diabetes need daily injections\\nof insulin to help their bodies use glucose. Some patients\\nwith T ype II diabetes may need to use insulin injections\\nif their diabetes cannot be controlled. Injections are\\ngiven subcutaneously—just under the skin, using a small\\nneedle and syringe. Purified human insulin is most com-\\nmonly used, however, insulin from beef and pork sources\\nalso is available. Insulin may be given as an injection of\\na single dose of one type of insulin once a day . Different\\ntypes of insulin can be mixed and given in one dose or\\nsplit into two or more doses during a day . Patients who\\nrequire multiple injections over the course of a day may\\nbe able to use an insulin pump that administers small\\ndoses of insulin on demand. In 2002, reports announced\\nthat early research shows a synthetic insulin called in-\\nsulin glargine might show promise for patients at risk for\\nhypoglycemia from insulin therapy .

The\\ninability to sense pain along with the complications of\\ndelayed wound healing can result in minor injuries, blis-\\nters , or callouses becoming infected and difficult to\\ntreat.

Odle\\nDiamond diet\\nDefinition\\nThe Diamond diet, popularly known as the Fit for\\nLife Program, is a way of eating designed to be em-\\nployed as a health lifestyle. Developed by Harvey and\\nMarilyn Diamond, it is a set of dietary principles intend-\\ned to serve as a blueprint for habits that can easily be-\\ncome routine, allowing individuals to take control of\\ntheir health.\\nOrigins\\nHarvey Diamond was an ill and underweight child\\nwith chronic and painful stomach problems. As a young\\nadult, his health problems continued as he became over-\\nweight. After experiencing the dieting merry-go-round\\nof losing and regaining his weight, Diamond decided\\nthat dieting does not work and that he needed to learn\\nhow to best care for his body . In 1970, Diamond found\\nhis answer in the concept of natural hygiene, an ap-\\nproach to the care and upkeep of the body that focuses\\non prevention of disease and healthful living. As de-\\nscribed by Diamond, the concept of natural hygiene\\nteaches that the body is self-cleansing, self-healing, and\\nself-maintaining. Healing powers are contained within\\nthe body itself. He states “the body is always striving for\\nhealth and .. achieves this by continuously cleansing it-\\nself of deleterious waste material. ” In combination with\\nan overall healthful lifestyle of adequate rest, exercise ,\\nsunshine, stress management, and interpersonal relation-\\nships, understanding how food impacts this cleansing\\nprocess allows individuals to eliminate the cause of their\\nhealth problems.\\nAlmost immediately upon Diamond’s introduction to\\nthis concept, his lifelong stomach pains ceased. Within\\none month, he had lost 50 pounds (a loss he was able to\\nmaintain). Diamond became a proponent of natural hy-\\ngiene and, in 1981, began a seminar program known as\\nThe Diamond Method. In 1983, he earned a doctorate in\\nnutritional science from the American College of Health\\nScience, a non-accredited college in Austin, T exas.

True to the tenets of nat-\\nural hygiene, the approach to eating laid out in the Fit for\\nLife books is designed to provide for optimal body func-\\ntioning by internal cleansing of illness-producing toxins.\\nAlthough weight loss and energy enhancements are posi-\\ntive results, the underlying goal is cleansing. Disease, as\\nunderstood in this approach, is “nothing more than the\\nbody’s own effort to cleanse itself of toxins. ” These tox-\\nins are the products of metabolic imbalance, or toxemia,\\nresulting from wastes. Dead cells, food residue, and ad-\\nditives build up in the bodies and cannot be eliminated at\\nthe same rate they are produced. Understanding and min-\\nimizing this level of toxemia is the key to healthy\\nlongevity . The dietary guidelines of the Fit for Life pro-\\ngram are designed to generate a minimum of toxic food\\nresidue within the body and to enable the body to contin-\\nuously expel the toxic waste that is produced. An addi-\\ntional intent is that the dietary guidelines incorporate\\ngood food and enjoyable meals rather than strict, hard-\\nto-follow regimens. If the program is stopped for any\\nreason, according to Diamond, it can be re-started with\\nalmost immediate results.\\nDescription\\nThe Fit for Life program places an emphasis not\\nonly on what foods are eaten, but also in what combina-\\ntions and at what time of day those foods are eaten.\\nThree general principles guide Diamond’s hygienic ap-\\nproach to eating.\\nThe Principle of High-Water-Content Food\\nW ater is vital to cleansing the inside of the body of\\naccumulated wastes. Consuming sufficient high-water-\\ncontent foods, fruits, and vegetables is crucial to accom-\\nplish this cleansing. Unlike drinking water, the water\\nfound in fruits and vegetables provides for the transport\\nof the nutrients found in those foods. It then flushes\\nwaste matter from the body .\\nThe Principle of Proper Food Combining\\nAccording to this principle, foods should be eaten in\\ncombinations that are most compatible with digestive\\nchemistry . Otherwise, the food will remain in the stom-\\nach longer than it should and cause digestive problems.\\nProteins and starches should not be eaten together be-\\ncause the stomach cannot digest both efficiently at the\\nsame time. For optimal digestion, proteins should be\\ncombined with vegetables at mealtime or a starch com-\\nbined with vegetables.\\nThe Principle of the Correct Consumption\\nof Fruit\\nFruit should be fresh and ripe when eaten. It should\\nbe eaten alone on an empty stomach, not with or after\\nanything else. The reason is that fruit requires no diges-\\ntion in the stomach and should be able to pass through\\nthe stomach quickly to help the body in its detoxifica-\\ntion efforts. Additionally , because fruit requires so little\\ndigestive energy , it should be eaten in the morning to\\nbest work with natural body cycles of food utilization\\nand elimination. The body needs to spend its energy on\\nproper cleansing during the morning hours rather than\\ndiverting crucial energy to digestive processes. Accord-\\ning to Diamond, the most beneficial habit a person can\\ndevelop is consuming exclusively fresh fruit and fresh\\nfruit juice from awakening until noon.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nProponents, including some nutrition and medical\\nprofessionals, claim benefits include weight loss, improved\\nenergy , and overall better health from following the pro-\\ngram. M.D.s, including Edward T aub, an Assistant Clinical\\nProfessor at the University of California, Irvine, and Kay\\nS. Lawrence, contributed to the first Fit for Life book. Crit-\\nics contend that the principles of the program disagree with\\nmuch established nutritional advice such as that provided\\nby the American Dietetic Association (ADA). The regimen\\ndoes not, for example, advocate weight loss by counting\\ncalories, recommend the basic food groups, or call to atten-\\ntion the health benefits of milk. Although the emphasis on\\nfresh fruits and vegetables is generally seen as positive, it is\\nalso called extreme by some reviewers. Reviewers in nutri-\\ntional publications have raised concerns about inadequate\\nprotein intake, the possibility of deficiencies in calcium,\\nzinc, some B vitamins (notably riboflavin and thiamine),\\nand iron deficiency anemia. Some nutritionists have also\\nargued that rigorously following the Fit for Life dietary\\nguidelines could lead to inadequate nutrition for the proper\\ndevelopment of growing children or fetuses. Critical re-\\nviews range from Environmental Nutrition’s assessment\\nthat the Fit for Life regimen is “probably not dangerous,\\n[but] has the potential to be unhealthy and therefore is not\\nrecommended” to the position of J. Lynne Brown, Ph.D.,\\nR.D. that if ”followed rigorously , it could lead to serious\\nhealth problems. ” Diamond rebuffs his critics, ADA guide-\\nlines and nutritional advice in particular, calling for a\\nbroader understanding of science, a quest for truth and less\\nemphasis on credentials which are, he argues, the way or-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 625\\nDiamond diet\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:23 PM  Page 625'),\n",

One of the primary\\ncauses of dermatitis in the diaper area is prolonged skin\\ncontact with wetness. Under these circumstances, natural\\noils are stripped away , the outer layer of skin is dam-\\naged, and there is increased susceptibility to infection by\\nbacteria or yeast.\\nDiaper rash is a term that covers a broad variety of\\nskin conditions that occur on the same area of the body .\\nSome babies are more prone to diaper rash than others.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nFrequently a flat, red rash is caused by simple chaf-\\ning of the diaper against tender skin, initiating a friction\\nrash. This type of rash is not seen in the skin folds. It\\nmay be more pronounced around the edges of the diaper,\\nat the waist and leg bands. The baby generally doesn’t\\nappear to experience much discomfort. Sometimes the\\nchemicals or detergents in the diaper are contributing\\nfactors and may result in contact dermatitis . These\\nrashes should clear up easily with proper attention. Ig-\\nnoring the condition may lead to a secondary infection\\nthat is more difficult to resolve.\\nFriction of skin against itself can cause a rash in the\\nbaby’s skin folds, called intertrigo. This rash appears as\\nreddened areas that may ooze, and is often uncomfort-\\nable when the diaper is wet. Intertrigo can also be found\\non other areas of the body where there are deep skin\\nfolds that tend to trap moisture.\\nSeborrheic dermatitis is the diaper area equivalent of\\ncradle cap. It is scaly and greasy in appearance and may\\nbe worse in the folds of the skin.\\nY east, or candidal dermatitis, is the most common in-\\nfectious cause of diaper rash. The affected areas are raised\\nand quite red with distinct borders, and satellite lesions\\nmay occur around the edges. Y east is part of the normal\\nskin flora, and is often an opportunistic invader when sim-\\nple diaper rash is untreated. It is particularly common after\\ntreatment with antibiotics, which kill the good bacteria\\nthat normally keep the yeast population in check. Usual\\ntreatments for diaper rash will not clear it up. Repeated or\\ndifficult to resolve episodes of yeast infection may war-\\nrant further medical attention, since this is sometimes as-\\nsociated with diabetes or immune problems.\\nAnother infectious cause of diaper rash is impetigo.\\nThis bacterial infection is characterized by blisters that\\nooze and crust.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe presence of skin lesions in the diaper area\\nmeans that the baby has diaper rash. However, there are\\nseveral types of rash that may require specific treatment\\nin order to heal. It is useful to be able to distinguish them\\nby appearance as described above.\\nA baby with a rash that does not clear up within two\\nto three days, or a rash with blisters or bleeding, should be\\nseen by a healthcare professional for further evaluation.\\nT reatment\\nGood diaper hygiene will prevent or clear up many\\nsimple cases of diaper rash. Diapers should be checked\\nvery frequently and changed as soon as they are wet or\\nsoiled. Good air circulation is also important for healthy\\nskin.

It may be necessary for\\nmothers to experiment with diaper types to see if the\\nbaby’s skin reacts better to cloth or disposable ones.

In the event of\\nsuspected yeast, a tablespoon of cider vinegar can be\\nadded to a cup of warm water and used as a cleansing so-\\nlution. This is dilute enough that it should not burn, but\\nacidifies the skin pH enough to hamper the yeast growth.\\nBarrier ointments can be valuable to treat rashes.\\nThose that contain zinc oxide are especially effective.\\nThese creams and ointments protect already irritated\\nskin from the additional insult of urine and stool, partic-\\nularly if the baby has diarrhea. Cornstarch powder may\\nbe used on rashes that are moist, such as impetigo.\\nNutrition\\nWhat the baby eats can make a difference in stool\\nfrequency and acidity . T ypically , breast-fed babies will\\nhave fewer problems with rashes. When adding a new\\nfood to the diet, the baby should be observed closely to\\nsee whether rashes are produced around the baby’s\\nmouth or anus. If this occurs, the new food should be\\ndiscontinued.\\nBabies who are taking antibiotics are more likely to\\nget rashes due to yeast. T o help bring the good bacterial\\ncounts back to normal, Lactobacillus bifidus can be\\nadded to the diet. It is available in powder form from\\nmost health food stores.\\nHerbal treatment\\nSome herbal preparations can be useful for diaper\\nrash. Calendula reduces inflammation, tightens tissues,\\nand disinfects. It has been recommended for seborrheic\\ndermatitis as well as for general inflammation of the\\nskin. The ointment should be applied at each diaper\\nchange. Chickweed ointment can also be soothing for ir-\\nritated skin and may be applied once or twice daily .\\nAllopathic treatment\\nAntibiotics are generally prescribed for rashes\\ncaused by bacteria, particularly impetigo. This may be a\\ntopical or oral formulation, depending on the size of the\\narea involved and the severity of the infection.\\nOver-the-counter antifungal creams, such as Lotrim-\\nin, are often recommended to treat a rash resulting from\\nyeast. If topical treatment is not effective, an oral anti-\\nfungal may be prescribed.\\nMild steroid creams, such as 0.5-1% hydrocortisone,\\ncan be used for seborrheic dermatitis and sometimes in-\\ntertrigo. Prescription strength creams may be needed for\\nshort-term treatment of more stubborn cases.\\nExpected results\\nTreated appropriately , diaper rash will resolve fairly\\nquickly if there is no underlying health problem or skin\\ndisease.\\nPrevention\\nFrequent diaper changes are important to keep the\\nskin dry and healthy . Application of powders and oint-\\nments is not necessary when there is no rash. Finding the\\nbest combination of cleansing and diapering products for\\nthe individual baby will also help to prevent diaper rash.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nEisenberg, Arlene, Heidi Murkoff, and Sandee Hathaway .

Greene’s HouseCalls\\nhttp://drgreene.com/960430.asp. (1996).\\nJudith Turner\\nDiarrhea\\nDefinition\\nT o most persons, diarrhea means an increased fre-\\nquency or softer consistency of bowel movements; how-\\never, the medical definition is more exact than this. Diar-\\nrhea best correlates with an increase in stool weight;\\nstool weights above 300 g per day generally indicates di-\\narrhea. This is mainly due to excess water, which nor-\\nmally makes up 60-85% of fecal matter. In this way , true\\ndiarrhea is distinguished from diseases that cause only\\nan increase in the number of bowel movements (hyper-\\ndefecation), or incontinence (involuntary loss of bowel\\ncontents).\\nDiarrhea is also classified by physicians into acute,\\nwhich lasts one to two weeks, and chronic, which contin-\\nues for longer than 23 weeks. V iral and bacterial infec-\\ntions are the most common causes of acute diarrhea.\\nDescription\\nIn many cases, acute infectious diarrhea is a mild,\\nlimited annoyance. However, acute infectious diarrhea\\nhas a huge impact worldwide, causing over five million\\ndeaths per year. While most deaths are among children\\nunder five years of age in developing nations, the impact,\\neven in developed countries, is considerable. For exam-\\nple, over 250,000 persons are admitted to hospitals in the\\nUnited States each year because of diarrhea. Rapid diag-\\nnosis and proper treatment can prevent much of the suf-\\nfering associated with this illness.\\nChronic diarrhea also has a considerable effect on\\nhealth, as well as on social and economic well being. Pa-\\ntients with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease,\\nand other prolonged diarrheal illnesses develop nutri-\\ntional deficiencies, which diminish growth and immuni-\\nty . They affect social interaction and result in the loss of\\nmany working hours.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nDiarrhea occurs because more fluid passes through\\nthe large intestine (colon) than can be absorbed. As a\\nrule, the colon can absorb several times more fluid than\\nis required on a daily basis. However, when this reserve\\ncapacity is overwhelmed, diarrhea occurs.\\nDiarrhea is caused by infections or illnesses that ei-\\nther lead to excess production of fluids or prevent ab-\\nsorption of fluids. Also, certain substances in the colon,\\nsuch as fats and bile acids, can interfere with water ab-\\nsorption and cause diarrhea. In addition, rapid passage of\\nmaterial through the colon can cause diarrhea.\\nSymptoms related to diarrheal illness are often those\\nassociated with any injury to the gastrointestinal tract,\\nsuch as fever , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain .\\nAll or none of these may be present depending on the\\ncause of diarrhea. The number of bowel movements can\\nvary with up to 20 or more per day . In some patients,\\nblood or pus is present in the stool. Bowel movements\\nmay contain undigested food material.\\nThe most common causes of acute diarrhea are in-\\nfections (the cause of traveler’s diarrhea), food poison-\\ning, and medications. Medications are a frequent and\\noften overlooked cause, especially antibiotics and\\nantacids. Both prescription and over-the-counter medica-\\ntions can contain additives, such as lactose and sorbitol,\\nthat will produce diarrhea in sensitive persons. Less\\noften, various sugar-free foods, which sometimes con-\\ntain poorly absorbable materials, cause diarrhea. Review\\nof allergies or skin changes may also point to a cause.\\nChronic diarrhea is frequently due to many of the\\nsame things that cause the shorter episodes (infections,\\nmedications, etc.); symptoms just last longer. Some in-\\nfections can become chronic. This occurs mainly with\\nparasitic infections (such as Giardia), or when patients\\nhave altered immunity (such as AIDS).\\nThe following are the more usual causes of chronic\\ndiarrhea:\\n• AIDS\\n• colon cancer and other bowel tumors\\n• endocrine or hormonal abnormalities (thyroid, diabetes\\nmellitus, etc.)\\n• food allergy\\n• inflammatory bowel disease ( Crohn’s disease and ul-\\ncerative colitis)\\n• lactose intolerance\\n• malabsorption syndromes (celiac and Whipple’s dis-\\nease)\\n• other (alcohol, microscopic colitis, radiation, surgery)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2628\\nDiarrhea\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nDermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:23 PM  Page 628'),\n",

Signs of dehydration can be hard to\\nnotice but include thirst,dry mouth, weakness or lighthead-\\nedness (particularly if worsening on standing), urine darken-\\ning, or a decrease in urination. Severe dehydration leads to\\nchanges in the body’s chemistry and could become life-\\nthreatening. Dehydration from diarrhea can result in kidney\\nfailure, neurological symptoms, arthritis, and skin problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nMost cases of acute diarrhea never need diagnosis or\\ntreatment, as many are mild and produce few problems.\\nBut patients with fever over 102°F (38.9°C), signs of de-\\nhydration, bloody bowel movements, severe abdominal\\npain, known immune disease, or recent use of antibiotics\\nneed prompt medical evaluation.\\nWhen diagnostic studies are needed, the most useful\\nare stool culture and examination for parasites; however\\nthese are often negative and a cause cannot be found in a\\nlarge number of patients. The earlier cultures are per-\\nformed, the greater the chance of obtaining a positive re-\\nsult. Stool samples of patients who had used antibiotics\\nin the preceding two months need to be examined for the\\ntoxins that cause antibiotic-associated colitis. T ests are\\nalso available to check stool samples for microscopic\\namounts of blood and for cells that indicate severe in-\\nflammation of the colon. Examination with an endo-\\nscope is sometimes helpful in determining severity and\\nextent of inflammation. T ests to check changes in blood\\nchemistry (potassium, magnesium, etc.) and a complete\\nblood count (CBC) may be performed.\\nChronic diarrhea is quite different, and most patients\\nwith this condition will receive some degree of testing.\\nMany exams are the same as for an acute episode, as\\nsome infections and parasites cause both types of diar-\\nrhea. A careful history to evaluate medication use, di-\\netary changes, family history of illnesses, and other\\nsymptoms is necessary . Key points in determining the\\nseriousness of symptoms are weight loss of over 10 lb\\n(4.5 kg), blood in the stool, and nocturnal diarrhea\\n(symptoms that awaken the patient from sleep). A com-\\nbination of stool, blood, and urine tests may be needed in\\nthe evaluation of chronic diarrhea; in addition a number\\nof endoscopic and x-ray studies are frequently required.\\nT reatment\\nDiet\\nTreatment is ideally directed toward correcting the\\ncause; however, the first aim is to prevent or treat dehy-\\ndration and nutritional deficiencies. When possible, food\\nintake should be continued even in patients with acute\\ndiarrhea. A physician should be consulted as to what\\ntype and how much food is permitted. Low-fat diets or\\nmore easily digestible fat is useful in some patients. The\\nBRA T diet, which limits food intake to bananas, rice, ap-\\nplesauce, and toast, can help to resolve diarrhea. These\\nfoods provide soluble and insoluble fiber without irrita-\\ntion. If the toast is slightly burnt, the charcoal can help\\nsequester toxins and pull them from the body .\\nThe patient should drink plenty of fluids, however, in\\nsevere cases hospitalization to provide intravenous fluids\\nmay be necessary . A physician should be notified if the\\npatient is dehydrated, and if oral replacement is suggested\\nthen commercial (Pedialyte and others) or homemade\\npreparations can be used. The W orld Health Organization\\n(WHO) has provided this easy recipe for home prepara-\\ntion, which can be taken in frequent small sips:\\n• table salt: 3/4 teaspoon\\n• baking powder: 1 teaspoon\\n• orange juice: 1 cup\\n• water: 1 quart or liter\\nSupplements\\nNutrient replacement also plays a role in preventing\\nand treating diarrhea. Zinc especially appears to have an\\neffect on the immune system, and deficiency of this min-\\neral can lead to chronic diarrhea. Also, zinc replacement\\nimproves growth in young patients.\\nDietary supplements that are generally beneficial in\\nthe treatment of digestive disorders include:\\n• vitamin C: 50-500 mg daily\\n• vitamin B\\n6: 50-150 mg daily\\n• magnesium aspartate: 400 mg daily\\n• vitamin E: 400 IU daily\\n• glutamine: 3,000 mg daily\\n• garlic, deodorized: 2,000 mg daily\\n• deghycirrhizinated licorice: chew as needed\\nProbiotics\\nProbiotics refers to treatment with beneficial mi-\\ncrobes either by ingestion or through a suppository . Studies\\nand the clinical use of probiotics have shown their utility in\\nthe resolution of diarrhea, especially antibiotic-associated\\ndiarrhea. Beneficial microbes include the bacteria Lacto-\\nbacillus acidophilus and L. bifidus and the yeast Saccha-\\nromyces boulardii.

The heat increases\\nblood flow , speeding up recovery . Doctors also use\\ndiathermy in surgical procedures by sealing blood ves-\\nsels with electrically heated probes.\\nThe term diathermy is derived from the Greek\\nwords therma, meaning heat, and dia, meaning through.\\nDiathermy literally means heating through.\\nOrigins\\nThe therapeutic effects of heat have long been recog-\\nnized. More than 2,000 years ago, the Romans took advan-\\ntage of heat therapies by building hot-spring bathhouses.\\nSince then, various methods of using heat have evolved. In\\nthe early 1890s, French physiologist Arséne d’Arsonval\\nbegan studying the medical application of high-frequency\\ncurrents. The term diathermy was coined by German\\nphysician Carl Franz Nagelschmidt, who designed a proto-\\ntype apparatus in 1906. Around 1925, United States doctor\\nJ. W . Schereschewsky began studying the physiological ef-\\nfects of high-frequency electrical currents on animals. It\\nwas several years, however, before the fundamentals of the\\ntherapy were understood and put into practice.\\nBenefits\\nDiathermy can be used to treat arthritis, bursitis ,\\nand other conditions involving stiff, painful joints. It is\\nalso used to treat pelvic infections and sinusitis. A bene-\\nfit of diathermy is that it is a painless procedure that can\\nbe administered at a clinic. Also, if the treatment relieves\\npain , then patients can discontinue pain killers and es-\\ncape their high cost and side effects.\\nDescription\\nDiathermy involves heating deep muscular tissues.\\nWhen heat is applied to the painful area, cellular metab-\\nolism speeds up and blood flow increases. The increased\\nmetabolism and circulation accelerates tissue repair. The\\nheat helps the tissues relax and stretch, thus alleviating\\nstiffness. Heat also reduces nerve fiber sensitivity , in-\\ncreasing the patient’s pain threshold.\\nThere are three methods of diathermy . In each, ener-\\ngy is delivered to the deep tissues, where it is converted\\nto heat. The three methods are:\\n• Shortwave diathermy . The body part to be treated is\\nplaced between two capacitor plates. Heat is generated\\nas the high-frequency waves travel through the body tis-\\nsues between the plates. Shortwave diathermy is most\\noften used to treat areas like the hip, which is covered\\nwith a dense tissue mass. It is also used to treat pelvic in-\\nfections and sinusitis. The treatment reduces inflamma-\\ntion. The Federal Communications Commission regu-\\nlates the frequency allowed for short-wave diathermy\\ntreatment. Most machines function at 27.33 megahertz.\\n• Ultrasound diathermy . In this method, high-frequency\\nacoustic vibrations are used to generate heat in deep\\ntissue.\\n• Microwave diathermy . This method uses radar waves to\\nheat tissue. This form is the easiest to use, but the mi-\\ncrowaves cannot penetrate deep muscles.\\nDiathermy is also used in surgical procedures. Many\\ndoctors use electrically heated probes to seal blood ves-\\nsels to prevent excessive bleeding. This is particularly\\nhelpful in neurosurgery and eye surgery . Doctors can\\nalso use diathermy to kill abnormal growths, such as tu-\\nmors, warts, and infected tissues.\\nPreparations\\nT o keep patients from sweating, patients are usually\\nasked to remove clothing from the body part being treated.\\nIf a patient sweats, the electrical currents may pool in the\\narea, causing burns. Also, clothing containing metal must\\nbe removed, as must earrings, buttons, barrettes, or zip-\\npers that contain metal. W atches and hearing aids should\\nbe removed because the therapy may affect their function.\\nPractitioners of surgical diathermy should steer\\nclear of alcohol-based solutions to prepare and cleanse\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 631\\nDiathermy\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:23 PM  Page 631'),\n",

Female\\npatients with metallic uterine implants, such as an IUD,\\nshould avoid treatment in the pelvic area. Diathermy\\nshould not be used in joints that have been replaced with\\na prosthesis or in those with sensory impairment who\\nmay not be able to tell if they are burning.

Diet plans that\\nclaim to accomplish those objectives are so numerous\\nthey are virtually uncountable. These diets employ a va-\\nriety of approaches, including the following:\\n• Fixed-menu: Offers little choice to the dieter. Specifies\\nexactly which foods will be consumed.

It is highly probable that they\\nwill become discouraged and drop out of such programs.\\nThe best diet is one that can be maintained indefinitely\\nwithout ill effects, that offers sufficient variety and bal-\\nance to provide everything needed for good health, and\\nthat is considerate of personal food preferences.\\nFad diets for quick weight loss are coming under in-\\ncreasing fire, since dieters seldom maintain the weight\\nloss. In 2001, researchers found that three times as many\\npeople on moderate fat weight loss diets stuck to their\\nplan compared to those on traditional low-fat diets. Not\\nonly do many diets offer only short-term and rapid\\nweight loss, some can be bad for the dieter’s health. For\\ninstance, the American Heart Association made a state-\\nment in late 2001 questioning the value of high-protein,\\nlow-carbohydrate diets. The association said that the\\ndiets don’t work over the long term and that they can\\npose some health risks to dieters. In 2003, these state-\\nments were largely supported. Though clinical trials\\nshowed that these types of diets worked in lowering\\nweight without raising cholesterol for the short-term,\\nmany of the participants gained a percentage of the\\nweight back after only one year. A physician group also\\nspoke out about high protein diets’ dangers for people\\nwith decreased kidney function and the risk of bone loss\\ndue to decreased calcium intake.\\nLow-fat diets are not recommended for children\\nunder the age of two. Y oung children need extra fat to\\nmaintain their active, growing bodies. Fat intake may be\\ngradually reduced between the ages of two and five, after\\nwhich it should be limited to a maximum of 30% of total\\ncalories through adulthood. Saturated fat should be re-\\nstricted to no more than 10% of total calories.\\nW eight-loss dieters should be wary of the “yo-yo”\\neffect that occurs when numerous attempts are made to\\nreduce weight using high-risk, quick-fix diets. This con-\\ntinued “cycling” between weight loss and weight gain\\ncan slow the basal metabolic rate and can sometimes\\nlead to eating disorders. The dieter may become discour-\\naged and frustrated by this success/failure cycle. The end\\nresult of yo-yo dieting is that it becomes more difficult to\\nmaintain a healthy weight.\\nCaution should also be exercised about weight-loss\\ndiets that require continued purchases of special\\nprepackaged foods. Not only do these tend to be costly\\nand over-processed, they may also prevent dieters from\\nlearning the food-selection and preparation skills essen-\\ntial to maintenance of weight loss. Further, dieters\\nshould consider whether they want to carry these special\\nfoods to work, restaurants, or homes of friends.\\nConcern has been expressed about weight-loss diet\\nplans that do not include exercise , considered essential\\nto long-term weight management. Some diets and sup-\\nplements may be inadvisable for patients with special\\nconditions or situations. In fact, use of the weight loss\\nsupplement ephedra was found to cause serious condi-\\ntions such as heart attack and stroke. In 2003, the U.S.\\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) was considering\\ncontrolling or banning the supplement. In short, most\\nphysician organizations see fad diets as distracting from\\nlearning how to achieve weight control over the long\\nterm through healthy lifestyle changes such as eating\\nsmaller, more balanced meals and exercising regularly .\\nCertain fad diets purporting to be official diets of\\ngroups such as the American Heart Association and the\\nMayo Clinic are in no way endorsed by those institu-\\ntions. Patients thinking of starting such a diet should\\ncheck with the institution to ensure its name has not been\\nmisappropriated by an unscrupulous practitioner.\\nSide effects\\nA wide range of side effects (some quite serious)\\ncan result from special diets, especially those that are nu-\\ntritionally unbalanced. Further problems can arise if the\\ndieter is taking high doses of dietary supplements. Food\\nis essential to life, and improper nutrition can result in\\nserious illness or death.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nIt is agreed among traditional and complementary\\npractitioners that many patients could substantially bene-\\nfit from improved eating habits. Specialized diets have\\nproved effective against a wide variety of conditions and\\ndiseases. However, dozens of unproved but widely publi-\\ncized “fad diets” emerge each year, prompting wide-\\nspread concerns about their usefulness, cost to the con-\\nsumer, and their safety .\\nT raining & certification\\nA wide variety of practitioners provide advice on di-\\netary matters.

Odle\\nDigestive enzymes\\nDescription\\nEnzymes are catalysts for virtually every biological\\nand chemical reaction in the body , and digestive en-\\nzymes are crucial for the breakdown of food into nutri-\\nents that the body can absorb. Digestive enzymes, of\\nwhich a variety are herbs, are used to treat a number of\\ndigestive problems and other conditions.\\nGeneral use\\nDigestive enzymes are used for relief of a number of\\ndigestive conditions, including:\\n• flatulence\\n• heartburn\\n• diarrhea\\n• spasms\\n• inflammation\\n• constipation\\n• gastroesophageal reflux\\n• peptic ulcers\\n• indigestion\\nMinor digestive complaints can be relieved by these\\nmild digestive enzymes, rather than the more pharmaco-\\nlogically active ones.\\nDigestive enzymes also may be used to treat and to\\nprovide relief to other conditions, such as anorexia,\\nCrohn’s disease , ulcerative colitis, parasitic infections,\\ncystic fibrosis, and pancreatitis.\\nCarminative herbs\\nCarminative herbs are considered to be mild and are\\nrich in volatile oils, which have antibacterial properties.\\nThese herbs include peppermint (Mentha spicata ), gin-\\nger (Zingiber officinale ), fennel (F oeniculum vulgare),\\nanise (Pimpinella anisum), and lemon balm (Melissa of-\\nficinalis). Carminative herbs help to stimulate peristalsis,\\nwhich is the wave-like action that pushes food through\\nthe digestive tract. These herbs can also help to relax the\\nsmooth muscle of the digestive tract, helping to reduce\\nspasms. The antibacterial properties of the volatile oils\\naid in reducing gas pains that result from bacteria in the\\nintestines acting on pieces of food that have not been di-\\ngested fully .\\nPeppermint is one of the oldest medicinal herbs.\\nPeppermint has three major actions in the body: it re-\\nduces nausea and vomiting , it encourages the liver to\\nproduce bile, and it clears the stomach of imbalanced\\nbacteria. It is particularly useful for treating spastic\\ncolon, irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. Pepper-\\nmint is also useful for reducing gas pain and indigestion.\\nDemulcent herbs can help ease heartburn, another\\nbothersome digestive condition. These herbs are rich in\\nmucilage, soothing irritated or inflamed tissue. Exam-\\nples of demulcent herbs include marsh mallow root (Al-\\nthaea officinalis ), Irish moss ( Chondrus crispus ), and\\nslippery elm (Ulmus rubra).\\nHerbs, known as bitters , can relieve constipation\\nand assist the stomach in acid digestion. Bitter herbs\\nstimulate bile production, and bile is the body’s natural\\nlaxative. T aking bitters in a capsule or pill form will not\\nwork because in order for the liver to produce bile, the\\nbitters must be tasted, not just ingested. Some examples\\nof a bitter herb are dandelion root ( T araxacum\\nofficinale), ginger, and aloe (Aloe vera).\\nGinger has been found to be particularly useful in\\ntreating nausea. In a 1988 study involving 80 Danish\\nnaval cadets who were unaccustomed to sailing heavy\\nseas, ginger capsules were found to be very beneficial in\\nreducing seasickness. Another study in 1990 at\\nBartholomew Hospital in London found ginger to be ef-\\nfective in reducing post-operative nausea. Ginger has\\nstimulating and antiemetic properties that warm the\\nstomach to reduce intestinal and gas pain.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 635\\nDigestive enzymes\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 635'),\n",

It is best not\\nto overeat, and snacking between meals on anything\\nother than fruit should be avoided. Increase the con-\\nsumption of fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and try to\\ndecrease the amount of fatty foods, red meat, dairy prod-\\nucts, nuts, and nut butters from the diet. Try to relax\\nwhile eating, chew food 10–20 times, and avoid distrac-\\ntions while eating, such as reading or watching televi-\\nsion.

Those who wish\\nto make their own tea should try steeping one teaspoon\\nof dry herb per cup of boiled water for five to 10 min-\\nutes.

After the product is marketed, the U.S. Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA) must prove the dietary supplement\\nunsafe before it can be removed from the shelves.

Anyone taking herbal products of any\\nkind should be certain to discuss this with their physician.\\nAs is the case with some prescription medications, depen-\\ndency on some herbal supplements is possible. No herbal\\nsupplements should be taken for extended periods of time\\nwithout discussing this with a physician first.\\nHerbal preparations can vary widely from one brand\\nto another, and within the same brand from one purchase\\nto the next, making inconsistency in the concentration of\\ningredients a potential risk. Anyone using herbal prod-\\nucts should be careful and try to use well-known brands\\nbecause these products are largely unregulated.\\nSide effects & interactions\\nAnyone taking herbal products should always dis-\\ncuss this with their physician.

(Cus-\\ntom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)\\nchance of developing diverticula increases with age, so\\nthat by the age of 50, about 20–50% of all people will\\nhave some diverticula. By the age of 90, virtually every-\\none will have developed some diverticula. Most divertic-\\nula measure 3–30 mm in diameter. Larger diverticula,\\ntermed giant diverticula, are quite infrequent, but may\\nmeasure as large as 15 cm in diameter.\\nThe great majority of people with diverticulosis will\\nremain symptom-free. Many diverticula are quite acci-\\ndentally discovered during examinations for other condi-\\ntions of the intestinal tract.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nDiverticula are believed to be caused by overly\\nforceful contractions of the muscular wall of the large in-\\ntestine. As areas of this wall spasm, they become weaker\\nand weaker, allowing the inner lining to bulge through.\\nThe anatomically weakest areas of the intestinal wall\\noccur next to the blood vessels that course through the\\nwall, so diverticula commonly occur in these locations.\\nDiverticula are most common among the popula-\\ntions of the developed countries of the W est (North\\nAmerica, Great Britain, and northern and western Eu-\\nrope). This is thought to be due these countries’ diets ,\\nwhich tend to be quite low in fiber. A diet low in fiber re-\\nsults in the production of smaller volumes of stool. In\\norder to move this smaller stool along the colon and out\\nof the rectum, the colon must narrow itself significantly ,\\nand does so by contracting down forcefully . This causes\\nan increase in pressure, which, over time, weakens the\\nmuscular wall of the intestine and allows diverticular\\npockets to develop.\\nDiverticulitis is believed to occur when a hardened piece\\nof stool, undigested food, and bacteria (called a fecalith) be-\\ncomes lodged in a diverticulum. This blockage interferes\\nwith the blood supply to the area, and infection sets in.\\nDiverticulitis is three times more likely to occur in\\nthe left side of the large intestine. Since most diverticula\\nare located in the sigmoid colon (the final segment of the\\nlarge intestine which empties into the rectum), most di-\\nverticulitis also takes place in the sigmoid. The elderly\\nhave the most serious complications from diverticulitis,\\nalthough very severe infections can also occur in pa-\\ntients under the age of 50. Men are three times more\\nlikely than women to be stricken with diverticulitis.\\nAn individual with diverticulitis will experience\\npain (especially in the lower left side of the abdomen)\\nand fever. In response to the infection and the irritation\\nof nearby tissues within the abdomen, the abdominal\\nmuscles may begin to spasm. About 25% of all patients\\nwith diverticulitis will have some rectal bleeding, al-\\nthough this rarely becomes severe. W alled-off pockets of\\ninfection, called abscesses, may appear within the wall\\nof the intestine, or even on the exterior surface of the in-\\ntestine. When a diverticulum weakens sufficiently , and is\\nfilled to bulging with infected pus, a perforation in the\\nintestinal wall may develop. When the infected contents\\nof the intestine spill out into the abdomen, a severe infec-\\ntion called peritonitis may occur. Peritonitis is an infec-\\ntion and inflammation of the lining of the abdominal\\ncavity , the peritoneum. Other complications of divertic-\\nulitis include the formation of abnormal connections,\\ncalled fistulas, between two organs which normally do\\nnot connect (for example, the intestine and the bladder),\\nand scarring outside of the intestine that squeezes off and\\nobstructs a portion of the intestine.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen diverticula are suspected because a patient be-\\ngins to have sudden rectal bleeding, the location of the\\nbleeding can be studied by performing angiography .

A dye\\n(contrast medium) which will show up on x-ray films, is\\ninjected into the catheter, and the area of bleeding is lo-\\ncated by looking for an area where the contrast is leaking\\ninto the interior (lumen) of the intestine.\\nA procedure called colonoscopy provides another\\nmethod for examining the colon and locating the site of\\nbleeding. In colonoscopy , a small, flexible scope\\n(colonoscope) is inserted through the rectum and into the\\nintestine. A fiber-optic camera that projects to a nearby\\ntelevision screen is mounted in the colonoscope, which\\nallows the physician to view the interior of the colon and\\nlocate the source of bleeding.\\nDiagnosis of diverticulitis is not difficult in patients\\nwith previously diagnosed diverticulosis. The presence\\nof abdominal pain and fever in such an individual would\\nmake the suspicion of diverticulitis quite high. Examina-\\ntion of the abdomen will usually reveal tenderness to\\ntouch, with the patient’s abdominal muscles contracting\\nstrongly to protect the tender area. During a rectal exam,\\na doctor may be able to feel an abnormal mass. T ouching\\nthis mass may prove painful to the patient.\\nWhen a practitioner is suspicious of diverticulitis as\\nthe cause for the patient’s symptoms, he or she will most\\nlikely avoid the types of tests usually used to diagnose\\ngastrointestinal disorders. These include barium enema\\nand colonoscopy (although colonoscopy may have been\\nused earlier to diagnose the diverticulosis). The concern\\nis that the increased pressure exerted on the intestine\\nduring these exams may increase the likelihood of in-\\ntestinal perforation. After medical treatment for the di-\\nverticulitis, these examinations may be performed in\\norder to learn the extent of the patient’s disease.\\nT reatment\\nTreatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis usually\\nrequires hospitalization, but some physicians will agree\\nto try treatment at home for very mildly ill patients.\\nThese patients will be put on a liquid diet and receive\\noral antibiotics. Although relaxation , guided imagery ,\\nand acupuncture treatment may be helpful in alleviating\\npain symptoms, a course of antibiotics is necessary to\\ntreat the infection itself.\\nAn infusion of herbs with anti-inflammatory and\\nsoothing properties, such as Mexican yam (Dioscorea\\nvillosa ), German chamomile (Matricaria recutita ),\\nmarsh mallow (Althaea officinalis ), and calamus\\n(Acorus calamus , or sweet flag) may be helpful in treat-\\ning the inflammation of diverticulitis. Ginger (Zingiber\\nofficinale ) can also be helpful in relieving gastrointesti-\\nnal gas that may be symptomatic of the disorder.\\nAllopathic treatment\\n“Resting the bowel” is a mainstay of treatment, and\\ninvolves keeping the patient from eating or sometimes\\neven drinking anything by mouth. Therefore, a patient\\nhospitalized for diverticulitis will need to receive fluids\\nthrough a needle in the vein (intravenous or IV fluids).\\nAntibiotics will also be administered through the IV . In\\ncases of severe bleeding (hemorrhaging), blood transfu-\\nsion may be necessary . Medications that encourage clot-\\nting may also be required.\\nWhile there are almost no situations when uncom-\\nplicated diverticulosis requires surgery , giant diverticula\\nalways require removal. This is due to the very high\\nchance of infection and perforation of these diverticula.\\nWhen giant diverticula are diagnosed, the usual treat-\\nment involves removing that portion of the intestine.\\nThe various complications of diverticulitis need to be\\ntreated aggressively , because the death rate from problems\\nsuch as perforation and peritonitis is quite high. Abscesses\\ncan be drained of their infected contents by inserting a\\nneedle through the skin of the abdomen and into the ab-\\nscess. When this is unsuccessful, open abdominal surgery\\nwill be required to remove the piece of the intestine con-\\ntaining the abscess. Fistulas require surgical repair, includ-\\ning the removal of the length of intestine containing the\\norigin of the fistula, followed by immediate reconnection\\nof the two free ends of intestine. Peritonitis requires open\\nsurgery . The entire abdominal cavity is cleaned by being\\nirrigated (washed) with a warmed sterile saltwater solu-\\ntion, and the damaged piece of intestine is removed. Ob-\\nstructions require immediate surgery to prevent perfora-\\ntion. Massive, uncontrollable bleeding, while rare, may re-\\nquire removal of part or all of the large intestine.\\nDuring any of these types of operations, the surgeon\\nmust make an important decision regarding the quantity\\nof intestine that must be removed. When the amount of\\nintestine removed is great, it may be necessary to per-\\nform a colostomy . A colostomy involves pulling the end\\nof the remaining intestine through the abdominal wall, to\\nthe outside. This bit of intestine is then fashioned so that\\na bag can be fit over it. The patient’s waste (feces) col-\\nlect in the bag, because the intestine no longer connects\\nwith the rectum. This colostomy may be temporary , in\\nwhich case another operation will be required to recon-\\nnect the intestine, after some months of substantial heal-\\ning has occurred. Other times, the colostomy will need to\\nbe permanent, and the patient will have to adjust to liv-\\ning permanently with the colostomy bag. Most people\\nwith colostomies are able to go on with a very active life.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2638\\nDiverticulitis\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 638'),\n",

Certain developments\\nwill identify those patients who are at very high risk of\\nexperiencing dangerous complications, such as those\\nwith a history of diverticulitis.\\nSurgery for chronic (recurring) diverticulitis remains\\ncontroversial. Some surgeons say that surgery prevents re-\\ncurrence of problems, while others say it does not. In 2002,\\na report to family physicians said that elective surgery in\\ncases of severe diverticulitis produces good outcomes and\\nlow rates of recurrence. However, patients should be cau-\\ntioned about possible postoperative complications such as\\nbleeding, abscess, and bowel obstruction. The risk of de-\\npends on functional bowel symptoms before surgery .\\nExpected results\\nThe prognosis for people with diverticula is excel-\\nlent, with only 20% of such patients ever seeking any\\nmedical help for their condition.\\nWhile diverticulitis can be a difficult and painful\\ndisease, it is usually quite treatable. Prognosis is worse\\nfor individuals who have other medical problems, partic-\\nularly those requiring the use of steroid medications,\\nwhich increase the chances of developing a serious in-\\nfection. Prognosis is also worse in the elderly .\\nPrevention\\nWhile there is no absolutely certain way to prevent\\nthe development of diverticula, it is believed that high-\\nfiber diets may help. Foods that are recommended for\\ntheir high fiber content include whole grain breads and\\ncereals, and all types of fruits and vegetables. Most ex-\\nperts suggest that individuals take in 20–35 grams of\\nfiber daily . If this is not possible to achieve through diet,\\nan individual may supplement with fiber products that\\nare mixed into juice or water.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHoffman, David.

In general, syncope is defined by a\\nbrief loss of consciousness (fainting) or by dimmed vi-\\nsion and feeling uncoordinated, confused, and lighthead-\\ned. Many people experience a sensation like syncope\\nwhen they stand up too fast. V ertigo is the feeling that ei-\\nther the individual or the surroundings are spinning. This\\nsensation is like being on a spinning amusement park\\nride. Individuals with nonsyncope nonvertigo dizziness\\nfeel as though they cannot keep their balance. This sen-\\nsation may become worse with movement.\\nDescription\\nThe brain coordinates information from the eyes, the\\ninner ear, and the body’s senses to maintain balance. If any\\nof these sources of information is disrupted, the brain may\\nnot be able to compensate. For example, people sometimes\\nexperience motion sickness because the information from\\ntheir body tells the brain that they are sitting still, but infor-\\nmation from the eyes indicates that they are moving. The\\nmessages don’t correspond and dizziness results.\\nV ision and the body’s senses are the most important\\nsystems for maintaining balance, but problems in the\\ninner ear are the most frequent cause of dizziness. The\\ninner ear, also called the vestibular system, contains fluid\\nthat helps to fine tune the information the brain receives\\nfrom the eyes and the body . When fluid volume or pres-\\nsure in the inner ear changes, information about balance\\nis altered. The discrepancy gives conflicting messages to\\nthe brain about balance and induces dizziness.\\nCertain medical conditions can cause dizziness be-\\ncause they affect the systems that maintain balance. For\\nexample, the inner ear is very sensitive to changes in\\nblood flow . Because such medical conditions as high\\nblood pressure or low blood sugar can affect blood flow ,\\nthese conditions are frequently accompanied by dizzi-\\nness. Circulation disorders are the most common causes\\nof dizziness. Other causes are head injuries, ear infec-\\ntions, allergies, and nervous system disorders.\\nDizziness often disappears without treatment or\\nwith treatment of the underlying problem, but it can be\\nlong-term or chronic. According to the National Insti-\\ntutes of Health, 42% of Americans will seek medical\\nhelp for dizziness at some point in their lives. The costs\\nmay exceed a billion dollars and account for five million\\nvisits to physicians annually . Episodes of dizziness in-\\ncrease with age. Among people aged 75 or older, dizzi-\\nness is the most frequent reason for seeing a doctor.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nCareful attention to symptoms can help determine\\nthe underlying cause of the dizziness. The underlying\\nproblems may be benign and easily treated, or they may\\nbe dangerous and require intensive therapy . Not all cases\\nof dizziness can be linked to a specific cause. More than\\none type of dizziness can be experienced at the same\\ntime and symptoms may be mixed. Episodes of dizziness\\nmay last for a few seconds or for days. The length of an\\nepisode is related to the underlying cause.\\nThe symptoms of syncope include dimmed vision,\\nloss of coordination, confusion, lightheadedness, and\\nsweating. These symptoms can lead to a brief loss of con-\\nsciousness or fainting. They are related to a reduced flow\\nof blood to the brain; they often occur when a person is\\nstanding up and can be relieved by sitting or lying down.\\nV ertigo is characterized by a sensation of spinning or turn-\\ning, accompanied by nausea, vomiting , ringing in the\\nears, headache, or fatigue. An individual may have trou-\\nble walking, remaining coordinated, or keeping balance.\\nNonsyncope nonvertigo dizziness is characterized by a\\nfeeling of being off balance that becomes worse if the in-\\ndividual tries moving or performing detail-intense tasks.\\nA person may experience dizziness for many rea-\\nsons. Syncope is associated with low blood pressure,\\nheart problems, and disorders in the autonomic nervous\\nsystem, which controls such involuntary functions as\\nbreathing. Syncope may also arise from emotional dis-\\ntress, pain, and other reactions to outside stressors. Non-\\nsyncope nonvertigo dizziness may be caused by rapid\\nbreathing, low blood sugar, or migraine headache ,a s\\nwell as by more serious medical conditions.\\nV ertigo is often associated with inner ear problems\\ncalled vestibular disorders. A particularly intense vestibu-\\nlar disorder, Ménière’s disease, interferes with the vol-\\nume of fluid in the inner ear. This disease, which affects\\napproximately one in every 1,000 people, causes intermit-\\ntent vertigo over the course of weeks, months, or years.\\nMénière’s disease is often accompanied by ringing or\\nbuzzing in the ear, hearing loss, and a feeling that the ear\\nis blocked. Damage to the nerve that leads from the ear to\\nthe brain can also cause vertigo. Such damage can result\\nfrom head injury or a tumor. An acoustic neuroma, for ex-\\nample, is a benign tumor that wraps around the nerve. V er-\\ntigo can also be caused by disorders of the central nervous\\nsystem and the circulation, such as hardening of the arter-\\nies (arteriosclerosis),stroke, or multiple sclerosis.\\nSome medications cause changes in blood pressure or\\nblood flow . These medications can cause dizziness in\\nsome people. Prescription medications carry warnings of\\nsuch side effects, but common drugs such as caffeine or\\nnicotine can also cause dizziness. Certain antibiotics can\\ndamage the inner ear and cause hearing loss and dizziness.\\nDiet may cause dizziness. The role of diet may be\\ndirect, as through alcohol intake.

Food sen-\\nsitivities or allergies can also be a cause of dizziness.\\nSuch chronic conditions as heart disease and serious\\nacute problems such as seizures and strokes can cause\\ndizziness. These conditions, however, usually exhibit\\nother characteristic symptoms.\\nDiagnosis\\nDuring the initial medical examination, an individ-\\nual with dizziness should provide a detailed description\\nof the type of dizziness experienced, when it occurs, and\\nhow often each episode lasts. A diary of symptoms may\\nhelp to track this information. The patient should report\\nany symptoms that accompany the dizziness, such as\\nringing in the ear or nausea, any recent injury or infec-\\ntion, and any medication taken.\\nThe examiner will check the patient’s blood pres-\\nsure, pulse, respiration, and body temperature as well as\\nthe ear, nose, and throat. The sense of balance is assessed\\nby moving the individual’s head to various positions or\\nby tilt-table testing. In tilt-table testing, the person lies\\non a table that can be shifted into different positions and\\nreports any dizziness that occurs.\\nFurther tests may be indicated by the initial exami-\\nnation. Hearing tests help assess ear damage. X rays,\\ncomputed tomography scan (CT scan), and magnetic res-\\nonance imaging (MRI) can pinpoint evidence of nerve\\ndamage, tumors, or other structural problems. If a\\nvestibular disorder is suspected, a technique called\\nelectronystagmography (ENG) may be used. ENG mea-\\nsures the electrical impulses generated by eye move-\\nments. Blood tests can determine diabetes, high choles-\\nterol, and other diseases. In some cases, a heart evalua-\\ntion may be useful. Despite thorough testing, however,\\nan underlying cause cannot always be determined.\\nDoctors caution that childhood syncope (fainting),\\nalthough rarely serious, can indicate a serious cardiac. If\\nthe fainting is abrupt or happens with exertion, it may in-\\ndicate a more serious problem.\\nT reatment\\nBecause dizziness may arise from serious condi-\\ntions, it is advisable to seek medical treatment. Alterna-\\ntive treatments can often be used alongside conventional\\nmedicine without conflict. Potentially beneficial thera-\\npies include nutritional therapy , herbal remedies, home-\\nopathy, aromatherapy, osteopathy, acupuncture, acu-\\npressure, and relaxation techniques.\\nNutritional therapy\\nT o prevent dizziness, nutritionists often advise eat-\\ning smaller but more frequent meals and avoiding caf-\\nfeine, nicotine, alcohol, foods high in fat or sugar, or any\\nsubstances that cause allergic reactions. A low-salt diet\\nmay also be helpful to some people. Nutritionists may\\nalso recommend certain dietary supplements:\\n• Magnesium citrate, aspartate or maleate: for dizziness\\ncaused by magnesium deficiency .\\n• B-complex vitamins, especially vitamin B\\n12: for dizzi-\\nness caused by deficiency of these essential vitamins.\\nHerbal remedies\\nThe following herbs have been used to treat dizzi-\\nness symptoms:\\n• Ginger: for treatment of dizziness caused by nausea.\\n• Ginkgo biloba: may decrease dizziness by increasing\\nblood flow to the brain.\\nHomeopathy\\nHomeopathic therapies can work very effectively for\\ndizziness, and are especially applicable when no organic\\ncause can be identified. They are chosen according to the\\npatient’s specific symptom profile:\\n• Aconite: for feeling light-headed from postural hy-\\npotension (getting up too quickly)\\n• Coccolus: for motion sickness or syncope\\n• Conium maculatum: for feeling dizzy while looking at\\nrapidly-moving images.\\n• Gelsemium: for feeling light-headed and out of bal-\\nance, often associated with influenza or stage fright.\\n• Petroleum: for dizziness upon standing up too fast and\\nheadache before and after a storm.\\nAromatherapy\\nAromatherapists recommend a warm bath scented\\nwith essential oils of lavender , geranium, and sandal-\\nwood as treatment for dizziness.

It is also known as\\nCaMg(CO3)2 and is a type of compact limestone consist-\\ning of a calcium magnesium carbonate. In combination\\nwith calcite and aragonite, dolomite makes up approxi-\\nmately 2% of the earth’s crust. The mineral was first de-\\nscribed by and then named after the French mineralogist\\nand geologist Deodat de Dolomieu (1750–1801).\\nDolomite is a fairly soft mineral that occurs as crys-\\ntals as well as in large sedimentary rock beds several\\nhundred feet thick. The crystals—usually rhombohedral\\nin shape—are transparent to translucent and are color-\\nless, white, reddish-white, brownish-white, gray , or\\nsometimes pink. In powdered form, dolomite dissolves\\nreadily with effervescence in warm acids.\\nAlthough rock beds containing dolomite are found\\nthroughout the world, the most notable quarries are lo-\\ncated in the Midwestern United States; Ontario, Canada;\\nSwitzerland; Pamplona, Spain; and Mexico.\\nFormation\\nAlthough dolomite does not form on the surface of the\\nearth at the present time, massive layers of dolomite can be\\nfound in ancient rocks. Dolomite is one of the few sedimen-\\ntary rocks that undergoes a significant mineralogical change\\nafter it is deposited. Dolomite rocks are originally deposited\\nas calcite/aragonite-rich limestone, but during a process\\ncalled diagenesis, the calcite and/or aragonite is transformed\\ninto dolomite. Magnesium-rich ground water containing a\\nsignificant amount of salt is thought to be essential to\\ndolomite formation. Thus, warm, tropical marine environ-\\nments are considered the best sources of dolomite formation.\\nChemical components\\nDolomite is composed of 52.06% oxygen, 13.03%\\ncarbon, 13.18% magnesium, and 21.73% calcium. Iron\\nand manganese carbonates, barium, and lead are some-\\ntimes present as impurities.\\nGeneral use\\nDolomite is commonly used in a variety of products.\\nA few of these are listed below:\\n• antacids (neutralizes stomach acid)\\n• base for face creams, baby powders, or toothpaste\\n• calcium/magnesium nutritional supplements for ani-\\nmals and humans\\n• ceramic glazes on china and other dinnerware\\n(dolomite is used as source of magnesia and calcia)\\n• fertilizers (dolomite added as soil nutrient)\\n• glass (used for high refractive optical glass)\\n• gypsum impressions from which dental plates are made\\n(magnesium carbonate)\\n• mortar and cement\\n• plastics, rubbers, and adhesives\\nAlthough calcium carbonate (the kind found in\\ndolomite) has the highest concentration of calcium by\\nweight (40%) and is the most common preparation avail-\\nable, this form of calcium is relatively insoluble and can be\\ndifficult to break down in the body . In contrast, calcium cit-\\nrate, although containing about half as much calcium by\\nweight (21%), is a more soluble form. Since calcium citrate\\ndoes not require gastric acid for absorption, it is considered\\na better source of supplemental calcium, particularly for the\\nelderly , whose stomach acid secretions are decreased.\\nCalcium supplements offer many benefits and recent\\nresearch even reports that calcium supplements can help\\nprevent formation of kidney stones when combined with\\na fairly low animal protein, low salt diet. Doctors once\\nadvised a low-calcium diet to prevent kidney stones.\\nPreparations\\nDolomite is generally ground into coarse or finely-\\ngrained powder and made into calcium/magnesium cap-\\nsules or antacids for human consumption. The powdered\\nform is also used in animal feed, fertilizers, and a variety\\nof other applications.\\nPrecautions\\nNutritional supplements\\nNot all commercially prepared calcium supplements\\nare tested for heavy metal contamination. In 1981 the Fed-\\neral Drug Administration (FDA) cautioned the public to\\nlimit the intake of calcium supplements made from\\ndolomite or bone meal (ground up cow’s bones) because of\\npotentially hazardous lead levels. Additional studies show\\nthat other calcium supplements, such as carbonates and var-\\nious chelates, may also contain hazardous amounts of lead.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 643\\nDolomite\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 643'),\n",

Dong quai’s ability to relieve men-\\nstrual problems has been attributed to its muscle-relax-\\ning properties and its ability to quiet spasms in the inter-\\nnal organs. Dong quai has a tonic effect on all female re-\\nproductive organs and increases blood flow to the uterus.\\nIt acts to increase vaginal secretions and to nourish vagi-\\nnal tissue. Dong quai root’s analgesic properties help di-\\nminish uterine pain and have been found to be as much\\nas 1.7 times as effective as aspirin. The herb has also\\nbeen useful in the treatment of migraine headaches.\\nOne recent W estern study , however, has called into\\nquestion the value of dong quai for treating menopausal\\nsymptoms. The authors of the study found that black co-\\nhosh appears to be a more effective herbal remedy for hot\\nflashes and other symptoms associated with menopause.\\nResearch in China indicates that dong quai stimu-\\nlates production of the red blood cells that carry oxygen\\nthroughout the body . Its sedative properties relieve emo-\\ntional distress and irritability . It is used to treat mild ane-\\nmia and as a liver tonic. The herb is beneficial to the en-\\ndocrine and circulatory systems, promoting healthful\\nblood circulation. Its laxative properties ease constipa-\\ntion, particularly in the elderly . This beneficial herb has\\nalso been proven effective against certain fungi, such as\\nCandida albicans, the primary cause of vaginal yeast in-\\nfection. Dong quai also helps to dissolve blood clots.\\nDong quai contains high amounts of vitamin E ,\\niron, cobalt, and other vitamins and minerals important\\nto women, including niacin , magnesium , potassium ,\\nand vitamins A, C, and B\\n12.

This Oriental medicinal herb is some-\\ntimes called the empress of herbs, or female ginseng.\\nDong quai grows best in such damp places as moist\\nmeadows, river banks, and mountain ravines. It may be\\nbiennial or perennial. The bitter-sweet root, described by\\nsome herbalists as resembling carved ivory , is used med-\\nicinally . Dong quai, variously known as dang gui or tang\\nkuei, produces a round, hollow , grooved stem that grows\\nas high as 7 ft. The lower leaves are large and tri-pinnate,\\neach further divided into two or three leaflets. The small-\\ner upper leaves are pinnate, which means that the leaflets\\nare arranged in opposite rows along the leaf stalk. The\\nleaves of dong quai resemble those of carrot, celery , or\\nparsley and emerge from dilated sheaths surrounding a\\nbluish-colored stem that is branched at the top. Honey-\\nscented, greenish-white flowers grow in large compound\\nflat-topped clusters and bloom from May to August.\\nGeneral use\\nDong quai is one of the most extensively researched\\nChinese medicinal herbs. It is well known as a female\\nremedy thought to benefit women throughout the men-\\nstrual cycle and during the transition to menopause .

Most Chinese herbalists use dong quai in combi-\\nnation with other herbs depending on the problems being\\naddressed and these are prepared together.\\nAlcohol tincture: Combine fresh or dry , chopped root\\nwith enough alcohol to cover in a glass container. Alcohol\\nshould be of good quality . A 50/50 alcohol/water ratio is\\noptimal. If the alcohol is not 100 proof, add pure water to\\nobtain a 50/50 ratio. Brandy , vodka, and gin are often\\nused.

Dosage: 10-40 drops of\\nthe fresh root tincture one to three times daily .\\nPrecautions\\nPregnant or lactating women are advised not to use\\ndong quai. Menstruating women who are experiencing\\nunusually heavy bleeding should discontinue use of\\ndong quai without advice of a qualified herbal practition-\\ner, because in certain preparations the herb may act to in-\\ncrease the blood flow . Consult a qualified herbalist be-\\nfore use if fibroids are present, or when there is unusual\\nbreast tenderness.\\nDong quai should not be used as a substitute for hor-\\nmonal replacement therapy , or HR T . W omen who are\\nconcerned about the possible side effects of HR T should\\nconsider fo-ti or such other herbs as licorice and hops.\\nSide effects\\nDong quai has been considered quite safe; however,\\nit may cause minor gastric upset in sensitive individuals.\\nStomach upset can be eliminated if dong quai is com-\\nbined with other herbs in preparation. The herb may also\\nincrease sensitivity to the sun and other ultraviolet expo-\\nsure in fair-skinned individuals.\\nMore seriously , a study published in 2002 reported\\nthat dong quai appears to encourage the growth of breast\\ncancer cells independent of its estrogenic activity . The\\nresearchers recommend cautious use of dong quai until\\ndefinitive studies can be performed. Interestingly , two\\nteams of researchers in the United States and China re-\\nspectively reported in 2003 that dong quai appears to sup-\\npress the growth of human prostate cancer cells.\\nInteractions\\nSome herbalists suggest that fruit consumption be\\ndecreased when using dong quai.\\nAs of 2003, dong quai has been reported to interact\\nwith some prescription medications, particularly antico-\\nphytochemicals, including coumarins, phytosterols,\\npolysaccharides, and flavonoids.\\nEuropean angelica ( A. archangelica ) stimulates se-\\ncretion of gastric juices and has been used to treat diges-\\ntive problems, flatulence, and loss of appetite. The root\\nof European angelica has sometimes been used in cases\\nof prolonged labor or to treat problems with retention of\\nthe placenta after childbirth.\\nAmerican angelica ( A. atropurpurea ) has also been\\nused by some herbalists for menstrual complaints,\\nthough the Chinese dong quai is most often used in for-\\nmulas for women.\\nPreparations\\nThe medicinal part of the angelica plant is the root.\\nDong quai root can be prepared as an infusion or decoc-\\ntion, tincture, tablet, or capsule. It is also available dried,\\neither whole, diced, or sliced. The herb is nontoxic, but\\nrecent findings suggest caution in using it over an ex-\\ntended period of time. The dried root may be chewed in\\nquarter inch segments two to three times daily , up to\\nthree to four grams per day .\\nInfusion or decoction: Research indicates that ex-\\ntracts of dong quai that retain the volatile constituents act\\nto raise blood pressure and relax uterine muscles.

Sjögren’s syndrome is\\nan autoimmune disorder in which the body’s white cells\\nattack the glands that produce saliva and tears. It is a\\ncommon cause of dry mouth in the elderly .\\nAlthough psychiatric disorders involving dry mouth\\nare unusual, several cases have been reported of somato-\\nform disorders in which dry mouth is a central symptom.\\nSomatoform disorders are psychiatric disturbances char-\\nacterized by external physical symptoms or complaints\\nthat are related to psychological problems rather than or-\\nganic illness.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of dry mouth is not difficult. The pa-\\ntient will state that his or her saliva is very thick or non-\\nexistent. Finding the cause of the dry mouth may be\\nmore difficult and require some laboratory testing. Sali-\\nvary gland biopsy for stones or tumors should be per-\\nformed if indicated.\\nT reatment\\nT o treat dry mouth, the use of caffeine-containing\\nbeverages, alcoholic beverages, and mouthwashes con-\\ntaining alcohol should be minimized. Drinking water and\\nfruit juices will decrease dry mouth problems. Chewing\\ngum and lemon drops can be used to stimulate saliva\\nflow . Bitters also can initiate salivary flow as long as the\\nsalivary glands and ducts are functional. Commercial\\nsaliva substitutes are available without prescription and\\ncan be used as frequently as needed. Use of a humidifier\\nin the bedroom reduces nighttime oral dryness.\\nHerbal therapy\\nThere are several herbal remedies that may be effec-\\ntive in increasing saliva production and preventing dry\\nmouth. Drinking ginger , chamomile , or Chinese green\\ntea at frequent intervals stimulates salivary flow . A Chi-\\nnese herbal mix of ophiopogois, pinelliae tuber, zizyphi\\nfructus, glycyrrhiaze, ginseng radix, and oryzae semen\\nhas been evaluated as treatment for dry mouth. Studies\\nhave shown this formula is effective in relieving dry\\nmouth in half of those tested, including severe cases,\\nsuch as cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy .\\nNutritional therapy\\nBecause dry mouth often causes gum disease , pa-\\ntients should take vitamin C and beta-carotene supple-\\nments as a preventive measure.\\nAcupuncture\\nAcupuncture has been tried since the late 1990s as\\na treatment for dry mouth caused by cancer treatments.\\nPractitioners at a California clinic that offers acupunc-\\nture to cancer patients use a total of eight needles, to\\nstimulate three points on each ear and one on each index\\nfinger. Of the 50 patients who have been treated with\\nacupuncture in this clinic, 35 reported significant im-\\nprovement in their salivation, and 13 reported that the\\nimprovement lasted for over three months before they re-\\nquired another treatment.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nTreatment of dry mouth involves management of the\\nunderlying condition. If dry mouth is caused by medica-\\ntion, the medication should be changed. If dry mouth is\\ncaused by blockage of the salivary ducts, the cause of the\\nblockage should be investigated. When such systemic\\ndiseases as diabetes and anemia are brought under con-\\ntrol, dry mouth problems may decrease.\\nSome new medications have been developed to treat\\ndry mouth associated with cancer therapy and Sjögren’s\\nsyndrome. Amifostine (Ethyol), a medication that pro-\\ntects the cells of the mouth against radiation and\\nchemotherapy agents, has been approved by the Food\\nand Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for dry\\nmouth related to cancer therapy . Pilocarpine hydrochlo-\\nride (Salagen) is a drug that was approved in 1998 for\\ntreating dry mouth associated with Sjögren’s syndrome;\\nit works by stimulating the salivary glands to produce\\nmore moisture.

He describes the ordinary ability of the person\\nwith dyslexia to visualize an object from multiple points\\nof view , a process which has a moving point of view and\\nwhich is spatially unanchored. When presented with a\\nword that is easily visualized as a known object, like\\nhorse, the dyslexic mind easily imagines the horse from\\nmultiple perspectives, and, so rapidly—somewhere be-\\ntween 400 to 2,000 times faster than those without\\ndyslexia— visual cues are processed ‘almost intuitively , ’\\ndemonstrating great mastery of the objectified visual\\nworld. However, when it comes to processing sound,\\nlanguage, speaking, handwriting and understanding ver-\\nbalized communication not associated with an object,\\nlike the words the or and, a series of non-image discon-\\nnections leads to confusion, disorientation, and an inabil-\\nity to adequately make sense of key pieces of visual in-\\nformation. T o the person with dyslexia, a simple seven\\nword sentence may look like a three word sentence with\\nfour blank spaces here and there.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAlthough an exact cause has not been identified,\\nstudies have identified differences in the way sound and\\nvisual information are processed between persons with\\nand without dyslexia. In the dyslexic individual these dif-\\nferences create what one NIH scientist refers to as a\\n“physiologic signature”—a unique brain pattern— per-\\nhaps the result of emphasized activity along dopamine re-\\nlated neuro-pathways. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, a\\nchemical substance acting in the brain that facilitates cer-\\ntain kinds of messages. According to one author, when\\ndopamine levels are high, the person with dyslexia expe-\\nriences time as moving very slowly outside themselves,\\nand very fast inside. As if time stands still. This author\\nalso notes that when the person with dyslexia experiences\\nepisodes of disorientation, when words or sounds do not\\ncreate a visual picture for them and their mind continues\\nto try and solve the confusion visually , dopamine levels\\nshift and change.

As a result,\\ndyslexia can be viewed as a developmental condition, a\\n“self-created condition, ” rather than as a disease. As each\\nindividual baby interprets visual data, and adapts to the\\nenvironment accordingly , developing their own individ-\\nual and unique brain patterns. It is that developmental\\npattern that is consistent among people with dyslexia.\\nWhen the individual’s mind cannot make sense of the\\ndata, confusion and disorientation result; incorrect data\\nis incorporated, causing the individual to make mistakes\\nthat leads to emotional reactions, primarily frustration. A\\nbehavior is adopted that constitutes a learning disability\\nbecause it disables future learning and, ultimately , af-\\nfects self esteem.\\nSometimes the learning disorder of dyslexia is inac-\\ncurately paralleled to Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)\\nor Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In\\na 2003 study , distinguishable differences between the\\ntwo learning disorders were readily apparent. Compar-\\ning 105 boys between the ages of eight and ten, from\\nthree different schools and cross divided into three dif-\\nferent groups—35 boys diagnosed with ADHD not tak-\\ning stimulant medication, 35 boys with dyslexia, and 35\\nboys without learning disabilities—the study found clear\\nand diagnostically useful differences in speech related\\npatterns between all groups. However, since diagnosis of\\na learning disability may be made between parents and\\nteacher or other school administrators on the basis of\\nsymptoms rather than clinical diagnostic testing, careful\\ndiagnosis, as always, is advisable.\\nT reatment\\nRonald D. Davis, writing in The Gift of Dyslexia\\noutlines an alternative and complementary treatment\\nconsistent with the “moving point of view” model. Ac-\\ncording to this model, and the reason why letters seem to\\nchange shape and float, why lines of print appear to\\nmove, and why words appear to be other than they are is\\nthat the dyslexic individual sees the world predominantly\\nthrough his or her “mind’s eye, ” rather than through his\\nor her physiologic eye. In other words, the person with\\ndyslexia more than all others, sees what he or she\\n‘thinks’ they see, rather than what their eyeballs see. T o\\nfurther complicate matters, they do this so quickly , they\\neasily become confused when the multiple facets do not\\nproduce a solid view . The object of treatment proposed\\nby Ronald Davis, a dyslexic individual himself, is to\\ntrain the mind’s eye to return to a learned, anchored,\\nviewpoint when they realize they are seeing with their\\nmind, and not with their eyeballs. This is accomplished\\nwith assessment testing, followed by one-on-one exercis-\\nes that retrain mental perception pathways. Using the\\ngifts of the dyslexic individual—their imagination and\\ncuriosity—these exercises involve creative physical ac-\\ntivities, including the use of modeling clay , “koosh”\\nballs,and movement training. Davis founded the Reading\\nResearch Council’s Dyslexia Correction Center in 1982,\\nand the Davis Dyslexia Association International, which\\ntrains educators and therapists, in 1995.\\nAnother alternative treatment option seeks to address\\nunmastered learning skills needed for reading and math.\\nThis system, called Audioblox, may be used one-on-one\\n(especially for children) or in groups, and involves a series\\nof mental exercises that address learning, focussing on the\\n“deficits” of dyslexia. Treatment involves the purchase of\\na kit online that contains a book entitled The Right to\\nRead, a supplementary manual, a computer program on\\nCD to supplement Audioblox training, and teaching mate-\\nrials. The book is in two parts; first, an explanation of theo-\\nry; second, the program itself, with exercises. The supple-\\nmentary manual contains specialized programs for areas of\\ndeficit, including handwriting, spelling, math, pre-school\\nreadiness, and high school or adult learning. The teaching\\nmaterials include 96 colored blocks, representing each of\\nsix colors on each of the six sides of the block; a view\\nblocking screen; colored cards with preprinted patterns;\\nletter cards; a reading book with a story written in the 800\\nmost common English words, and word cards; and, a\\ndemonstration video.

Menstruating women of\\nany age can experience cramps.\\nWhile the pain may be only mild for some women,\\nothers experience severe discomfort that can significantly\\ninterfere with everyday activities for several days each\\nmonth. In fact, about 43 % of women in the United States\\nsuffer pain so severe that it disrupts their daily lives and\\nabout 18% miss one or more days or work, school, or\\nother activities each year because of menstrual cramps.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nDysmenorrhea is called “primary” when there is no\\nspecific abnormality , and “secondary” when the pain is\\ncaused by an underlying gynecological problem. It is be-\\nlieved that primary dysmenorrhea occurs when\\nprostaglandins, hormone-like substances produced by\\nuterine tissue, trigger strong muscle contractions in the\\nuterus during menstruation. However, the level of\\nprostaglandins does not seem to correlate with how\\nstrong a woman’s cramps are. Some women have high\\nlevels of prostaglandins and no cramps, whereas other\\nwomen with low levels have severe cramps. This is why\\nexperts assume that cramps must also be related to other\\ncauses, such as diets, genetics, stress, and different body\\ntypes, in addition to prostaglandins. The first year or two\\nof a girl’s periods are not usually very painful. However,\\nonce ovulation begins, the blood levels of the\\nprostaglandins rise, leading to stronger contractions.\\nSecondary dysmenorrhea may be caused by en-\\ndometriosis, fibroid tumors, or an infection in the pelvis.\\nThe likelihood that a woman will have cramps in-\\ncreases if she:\\n• has a family history of painful periods\\n• leads a stressful life\\n• doesn’t get enough exercise\\n• uses caffeine\\n• has pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\\nSymptoms include a dull, throbbing cramping in the\\nlower abdomen that may radiate to the lower back and\\nthighs. In addition, some women may experience nausea\\nand vomiting , diarrhea , irritability , sweating, or dizzi-\\nness. Cramps usually last for two or three days at the be-\\nginning of each menstrual period. Many women often\\nnotice their painful periods disappear after they have\\ntheir first child, probably due to the stretching of the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 653\\nDysmenorrhea\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 653'),\n",

Smoking has been found to worsen\\ncramps.\\n• T aking daily multi-vitamin and mineral supplements\\nthat contain high doses of magnesium and vitamin B 6\\n(pyridoxine ), and flaxseed or fish oil supplements. Re-\\ncent research suggests that vitamin B supplements, pri-\\nmarily vitamin B\\n6 in complex, magnesium, calcium,\\nzinc , vitamin E , and fish oil supplements ( omega-3\\nfatty acids) also may help relieve cramps.\\nHerbal therapy\\nAn herbalist may recommend one of the following\\nherbal remedies for menstrual pain:\\n• Chasteberry ( V itex agnus-castus) for women who also\\nexperience breast pain, irregular periods, and ovarian\\ncysts.\\n• Dong quai ( Angelica sinensis ) for women with typical\\nmenstrual pain.\\n• Licorice ( Glycyrrhiza glabra ) for abdominal bloating\\nand cramping.\\n• Black cohosh ( Cimifuga racemosa ) for relief of men-\\nstrual pain as well as mood swing and depression.\\nYoga\\nSeveral yoga positions are popular as methods to\\nease menstrual pain. In the “cat stretch” position, the\\nwoman rests on her hands and knees, slowly arching the\\nback. The pelvic tilt is another popular yoga position, in\\nwhich the woman lies with knees bent, and then lifts the\\npelvis and buttocks.\\nExercise\\nExercise may be a way to reduce the pain of men-\\nstrual cramps through the brain’s production of endor-\\nphins, the body’s own painkillers.\\nOther remedies\\nAcupuncture and Chinese herbs are other popular\\nalternative treatments for cramps. There are particular\\nformulas depending on the pattern of imbalance. Aro-\\nmatherapy and massage may ease pain for some\\nwomen. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation\\n(TENS) has been touted as a safe and practical way to\\nrelieve the pain of dysmenorrhea. It works by using elec-\\ntrodes to stimulate nerve fibers. Some women find relief\\nthrough visualization, concentrating on the pain as a par-\\nticular color and gaining control of the sensations. Oth-\\ners find that imagining a white light hovering over the\\npainful area can actually lessen the pain for brief peri-\\nods. Simply changing the position of the body can help\\nease cramps. The simplest technique is assuming the\\nfetal position with knee pulled up to the chest while hug-\\nging a heating pad or pillow to the abdomen. Also, or-\\ngasm can make a woman feel more comfortable by re-\\nleasing tension in the pelvic muscles.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nSeveral drugs can lessen or completely eliminate the\\npain of primary dysmenorrhea.

It\\nmay also be a symptom of problems in the mouth, nose,\\nor throat. Infants or very young children may be unable\\nto say that they are in pain. Increased irritability or\\npulling at the ears is often a sign of ear pain in infants.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe most common cause of an earache is a buildup\\nof pressure in the eustachian tube. Among other func-\\ntions, the eustachian tube drains fluids out of the middle\\near via the back of the throat. A cold, allergy , or sore\\nthroat can cause the eustachian tube to swell shut. In-\\nfants and young children are especially susceptible to\\nearaches caused by problems with the eustachian tube,\\nsince the structure is still underdeveloped in that age\\ngroup. When the normal drainage of fluid is prevented, it\\ncan accumulate in the middle ear, causing pressure, pain,\\nstagnation, and possibly infection.\\nAn earache may be due to a perforated, or broken,\\neardrum. The eardrum can be broken as a result of a\\nblow to the head, infection in the inner ear, suction ap-\\nplied to the ear, or the insertion of a foreign object into\\nthe ear. Infections of the middle and outer ears are often\\nassociated with earaches. Other causes of an earache\\nmay be the obstruction of the ear canal with a foreign\\nobject or excessive ear wax, boils in the ear canal, a her-\\npes zoster infection of the ear, keratosis of the ear, tu-\\nmors, an infection of the mastoid process, “swimmer’s\\near, ” and the aftermath of surgical procedures. Ear pain\\ncan also be caused by a rapid descent from high alti-\\ntudes, during air travel or travel in the mountains. A\\nsinus infection , arthritis of the jaw , sore throat, tonsilli-\\ntis, and dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint\\n(TMJ) may be the source of referred pain to the ears.\\nDiagnosis\\nA history of the illness should be obtained, includ-\\ning information about the symptoms accompanying the\\nearache. A physical exam should be performed, which\\nmay include an examination of the ears, the nasal pas-\\nsages and sinuses, and the throat. An otoscope may be\\nused to see more deeply into the ears, nose, and throat. In\\naddition, the teeth, tongue, tonsils, salivary glands, and\\nTMJ should be examined for problems that might be\\ncausing referred pain to the ears. A culture and sensitivi-\\nty test should be done if there is any discharge from the\\nears. X rays or a computed tomography (CT) scan may\\nbe required to diagnose the problem.

It\\nis characterized by pain , dizziness , and partial loss of\\nhearing.\\nDescription\\nA little knowledge of the basic anatomy of the mid-\\ndle ear will be helpful for understanding the develop-\\nment of otitis media. The external ear canal is a tube that\\nleads from the outside opening of the ear to a structure\\ncalled the tympanic membrane. Behind the tympanic\\nmembrane is the space called the middle ear. Within the\\nmiddle ear are three tiny bones called ossicles. These are\\nthe malleus, the incus, and the stapes. Their shapes are\\noften described as a hammer, an anvil, and a stirrup.\\nSound in the form of vibration causes movement in the\\neardrum, and then in the chain of ossicles. The ossicles\\ntransmit the sound to the cochlea within the inner ear,\\nwhich sends it to the brain for processing.\\nThe nasopharynx is the passageway behind the\\nnose that takes inhaled air into the breathing tubes\\nleading to the lungs. The eustachian tube is a canal that\\nruns between the middle ear and the nasopharynx. One\\nof the functions of the eustachian tube is to keep the\\nair pressure in the middle ear equal to that outside.\\nThis equalization of the air pressure allows the\\neardrum and ossicles to vibrate appropriately , so that\\nhearing is normal.\\nBy age three, almost 85% of all children will have\\nhad otitis media at least once. It is the most common\\npediatric complaint. Babies and children between the\\nages of six months and six years are most likely to de-\\nvelop otitis media. Children at higher risk for otitis\\nmedia include boys, children from poor families, those\\nwith allergies , Native Americans, Native Alaskans,\\nchildren born with cleft palate or other defects of the\\nstructures of the head and face, and children with Down\\nsyndrome. Babies whose first ear infection occurs prior\\nto six months of age are more prone to chronic prob-\\nlems with otitis media. There also appears to be some\\ngenetic predisposition towards otitis media, which may\\nbe related to the structure and function of the area in\\nand around the middle ear. Exposure to cigarette smoke\\nsignificantly increases the risk of ear infections ,a s\\nwell as other problems affecting the respiratory system.\\nIn addition, children who enter daycare at an early age\\nhave more upper respiratory infections (URIs or colds),\\nand thus more cases of otitis media. Although the ear\\ninfection itself is not contagious, the URIs that predis-\\npose children to them certainly are. The most common\\ntimes of year for otitis media to strike are winter and\\nearly spring, which are the same times that URIs are\\nmost common.\\nOtitis media is an important medical problem, be-\\ncause it often results in fluid accumulation within the\\nmiddle ear. This is known as otitis media with effusion\\n(OME). The effusion can last for weeks to months. Effu-\\nsion within the middle ear can cause significant hearing\\nimpairment. When such hearing impairment occurs in a\\nyoung child, it may interfere with the development of\\nnormal speech and language processing. A chronic effu-\\nsion also increases the risk for subsequent infections, as\\nthe fluid provides a growth medium for bacteria.\\nIn adults, acute otitis media can lead to such compli-\\ncations as paralysis of the facial nerves. Recovery from\\nthese complications may take from two weeks to as long\\nas three months.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe first precondition for the development of acute\\notitis media is exposure to an organism capable of caus-\\ning the infection. Otitis media can be caused by either\\nviruses or bacteria. V irus infections account for about\\n15% of cases. The three most common bacterial\\npathogens are Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus\\ninfluenzae , or Moraxella catarrhalis . As of 2003, about\\n75% of ear infections caused by S. pneumoniae are re-\\nported to be resistant to penicillin.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 659\\nEar infection\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 659'),\n",

A common condition occurring in childhood, it\\nis estimated that 85% of all American children will develop otitis media at least once.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.\\nThe Gale Group.)\\nOtitis media may also be caused by other disease or-\\nganisms, including Bordetella pertussis , the causative\\nagent of whooping cough , and Pneumocystis carinii ,\\nwhich often causes opportunistic infections in patients\\nwith AIDS.\\nThere are other factors that make the development\\nof an ear infection more likely . Because the eustachian\\ntube has a more horizontal orientation and is consider-\\nably shorter in early childhood, material from the na-\\nsopharynx can easily reach the middle ear. Discharges\\nfrom the nasopharynx include infection-causing organ-\\nisms. Children also have a lot of lymph tissue, some of\\nwhich makes up the adenoids, in the area of the eustachi-\\nan tube. The adenoids may enlarge with repeated respira-\\ntory tract infections, ultimately blocking the eustachian\\ntubes. When the eustachian tube is blocked, the middle\\near is more likely to fill with fluid. This fluid increases\\nthe risk of infection, and the corresponding risks of\\nhearing loss and delayed speech development.\\nRecent advances in gene mapping have led to the\\ndiscovery of genetic factors that increase a child’s sus-\\nceptibility to otitis media. Researchers are hoping to de-\\nvelop molecular diagnostic assays that will help to iden-\\ntify children at risk for severe ear infections.\\nMost cases of acute otitis media occur during the\\ncourse of a URI. Symptoms may include cold symptoms,\\nfever , ear pain, irritability , and problems with hearing.\\nBabies may have difficulty feeding. When significant\\nfluid is present within the middle ear, pain can increase\\ndepending on position. Lying down may cause an in-\\ncrease in painful pressure within the middle ear, so that\\nbabies often fuss if not held upright. Older children\\nsometimes complain of a full sensation in the affected\\near. If the fluid build-up behind the eardrum is sufficient,\\nthe eardrum may develop a hole (perforate), causing\\nbloody fluid or greenish-yellow pus to drip from the ear.\\nAlthough the pain may be severe before the eardrum per-\\nforates, the pain is usually relieved by the reduction of\\npressure brought on by a perforation.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is usually made simply by looking at the\\neardrum through a special lighted instrument called an\\notoscope.

Under normal conditions, the ossicles create a\\nparticular pattern on the eardrum, referred to as “land-\\nmarks. ” These landmarks may be obscured in the course\\nof an infection. Normally , the light from the otoscope re-\\nflects off the eardrum in a characteristic fashion. This is\\ncalled the “cone of light. ” In an infection, this cone of\\nlight may be shifted or absent.\\nA special attachment to the otoscope allows the ex-\\naminer to blow a puff of air gently into the ear. Normal-\\nly , this should cause movement of the eardrum. In an in-\\nfection, or when there if fluid behind the eardrum, this\\nmovement may be decreased or absent. Movement of the\\neardrum can also be assessed by a tympanogram. A tym-\\npanogram is a quick, painless test. If there is fluid in the\\nmiddle ear, the tympanogram reading will be flat. If the\\nmiddle ear is filled with air, as it is normally , the test will\\nalso show whether it is at higher or lower pressure than it\\nshould be. This measurement could be an indicator of\\nabnormal function of the eustachian tube.\\nHearing tests, or audiograms, are sometimes used to\\ndetermine whether hearing loss has occurred because of\\ninfection or persistent fluid, and whether the loss is se-\\nvere. A hearing screen for children old enough to de-\\nscribe their own hearing reliably can be performed in\\nschools or at the pediatrician’s office. More accurate\\ntesting is done in a soundproof booth by an audiologist.\\nThis method can also be modified for use with children\\nwho can’t give a verbal indication that they have heard a\\nsound, but are old enough to turn their heads to see the\\nsource of a noise.\\nFluid or pus draining from the ear can be collected.\\nThis sample can then be processed in a laboratory to allow\\nany organisms present to multiply sufficiently (cultured)\\nto permit the organisms to be viewed under a microscope\\nand identified. Cultures are also used to determine the sen-\\nsitivity of the organisms to specific antibiotics.\\nT reatment\\nChiropractic\\nOne particular chiropractic procedure, known as\\nthe endonasal technique, is thought to help the eustachi-\\nan tube to open and thus improve drainage of the middle\\near. The tube is sometimes blocked off due to exudates\\nor inflammatory processes. The endonasal technique can\\noffer significant relief from earache.\\nCraniosacral therapy and osteopathy\\nCraniosacral therapy uses gentle manipulation of\\nthe bones of the skull to relieve pressure and improve eu-\\nstachian tube function. This treatment may also help the\\neustachian tubes to assume a position in which they can\\ndrain on their own. The pressure exerted on a baby’s head\\nduring the birth process sometimes contributes to the\\ntubes being in a position in which it is hard for them to\\ndrain. Osteopaths practice a similar gentle manipulation of\\nthe bones of a child’s head. One osteopathic study of chil-\\ndren from kindergarten through third grade in a Missouri\\nschool district found a dir ect correlation between abnor-\\nmal head shape at birth and susceptibility to otitis media\\nduring the early elementary school years. As of 2003 there\\nare pediatric osteopaths who specialize in cranial work.\\nHerbal therapy\\nA number of herbal treatments for otitis media have\\nbeen recommended, including eardrops made with gold-\\nenseal (Hydrastis canadensis ), mullein (V erbascum\\nthapsus), St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum ), and\\nechinacea (Echinacea spp.). Tinctures of echinacea,\\nthyme (Thymus vulgaris ), and elderflower ( Sambucus\\nnigra) are often recommended for oral treatment of otitis\\nmedia due to chronic congestion. W arm garlic oil can be\\ninstilled directly into the ear. Steam inhalation infused\\nwith eucalyptus or chamomile may reduce the conges-\\ntion of the URIs that often accompany otitis media.\\nHomeopathy\\nHomeopathic remedies that may be prescribed for\\nmiddle ear infections include aconite, ferrum phospho-\\nricum, belladonna , chamomilla, lycopodium , pulsatil-\\nla, or silica.\\nNutrition\\nSome practitioners believe that food allergies may in-\\ncrease the risk of ear infections, and they suggest eliminat-\\ning suspected food allergens from the diet. The top food\\nallergens are wheat, dairy products, corn, peanuts, citrus\\nfruits, and eggs. Elimination of sugar and sugar products\\ncan allow the immune system to work more effectively .\\nOther nutritionists have noted that children who were\\nbreastfed as babies are less susceptible to ear infections.\\nAcupuncture\\nAcupuncture can help to reestablish a normal flow\\nof fluids within the head.

This decision involves knowledge of the types\\nof antibiotics that have worked on other ear infections oc-\\ncurring within a particular community at a particular\\ntime. Options include sulfa-based antibiotics, as well as a\\nvariety of penicillins, cephalosporins, and others. The pa-\\ntient’s sensitivity to certain medications, as well as previ-\\nously demonstrated resistant strains, also contributes to\\nthe choice of antibiotic. As of 2003, an 0.3% topical solu-\\ntion of ofloxacin has been recommended as a more effec-\\ntive medication than other oral or topical antibiotics.\\nFollowing a course of antibiotic treatment, approxi-\\nmately 40% of children will continue to have fluid be-\\nhind the eardrum, resulting in otitis media with effusion\\n(OME). The eardrum is no longer red or infected. The\\nfluid may take weeks to months to resolve. Generally , it\\nis safe to allow this condition to continue with observa-\\ntion for up to 12 weeks. At that time, hearing should be\\ntested. If hearing loss is insignificant or only in one ear,\\nobservation can continue for up to a total of 4–6 months,\\nat which time placement of ventilation tubes in the\\neardrum is often recommended. The tube functions as an\\naccessory eustachian tube until it falls out. If hearing\\nloss is significantly affecting both ears at any time after\\nsix weeks from diagnosis of OME, antibiotic treatment\\nor tube placement should be considered.\\nThe overuse of antibiotics is contributing to some\\nstrains of bacteria—particularly S. pneumoniae —devel-\\noping resistance and becoming more difficult to treat.\\nResearch is being done to try to help determine whether\\nthere may be some ear infections that would resolve\\nwithout antibiotic treatment. One pediatrician has sug-\\ngested some changes in usage of antibiotics for otitis\\nmedia. He describes five factors to use to determine\\nwhether antibiotic treatment can be limited to five days\\nor perhaps avoided altogether. The factors to consider are\\nthe age of the child; time of year; severity of the infec-\\ntion; frequency of infection; and rapidity of response to\\nantibiotics. Generally , otitis media clears more readily\\nwhen it occurs in an older child, in the summer, and\\ncauses relatively mild symptoms in a child who has not\\nexperienced frequent infections in the past. Given these\\nfactors, it may be possible to avoid antibiotic use. The\\npatient must be monitored to be sure the infection clears\\nwithout complication. If antibiotic treatment is initiated\\nand the infection clears quickly , a five-day course of\\nmedication may be all that’s needed.\\nWhether or not antibiotics are used, such pain reliev-\\ners as T ylenol or Motrin can be very helpful in reducing\\nthe pain and inflammation associated with otitis media.\\nThe use of decongestants and antihistamines does\\nnot appear to shorten the course of infection.\\nSurgery\\nIn a few rare cases, a surgical perforation to drain\\nthe middle ear of pus may be performed. This procedure\\nis called a myringotomy . The hole created by the\\nmyringotomy generally heals itself in about a week. In\\n2002 a new minimally invasive procedure was intro-\\nduced that uses a laser to perform the myringotomy . It\\ncan be performed in the doctor’s office and heals more\\nrapidly than the standard myringotomy .\\nAlthough some doctors have recommended remov-\\ning the adenoids to prevent recurrent otitis media in\\nyoung children, recent studies indicate that surgical re-\\nmoval of the adenoids does not appear to offer any ad-\\nvantages over a myringotomy as a preventive measure.\\nExpected results\\nWith treatment, the prognosis for acute otitis media\\nis very good. Long-lasting accumulations of fluid within\\nthe middle ear, however, place the patient at risk both for\\ndifficulties with hearing and speech, and for the repeated\\ndevelopment of ear infections. Furthermore, without\\ntreatment, otitis media occasionally leads to serious\\ncomplications, including an infection within the nearby\\nmastoid bone, called mastoiditis.\\nPrevention\\nAlthough otitis media seems inevitable in child-\\nhood, some measures can be taken to decrease the\\nchance of repeated infections and fluid accumulation.\\nBreastfeeding provides some protection against URIs,\\nwhich in turn protects against the development of otitis\\nmedia. If a child is bottle-fed, parents should be advised\\nto feed him or her upright, rather than allowing the baby\\nto lie down with the bottle. General good hygiene prac-\\ntices (especially hand washing) help to decrease the\\nnumber of upper respiratory infections in a household or\\ndaycare center. Hand sanitizers are preferable to antibac-\\nterial soaps, which may contribute to bacterial resistance.\\nThe use of pacifiers should be avoided or limited.\\nThey may act as fomites, particularly in a daycare set-\\nting. In children who are more susceptible to otitis\\nmedia, pacifier use can increase by as much as 50% the\\nnumber of ear infections experienced.\\nT wo vaccines can prevent otitis media associated\\nwith certain strains of bacteria.

Most often referred to as the pur-\\nple coneflower, this hardy plant is also known as Sampson\\nroot, Missouri snakeroot, and rudbeckia. The prominent,\\nbristly seed head inspired the generic name of the plant,\\ntaken from the Greek word,echinosmeaning hedgehog.\\nEchinacea is a North American prairie native, abun-\\ndant in the mid west and cultivated widely in ornamental\\nand medicinal gardens. The purple-pink rays of the blos-\\nsom droop downward from a brassy hued center cone\\ncomposed of many small, tubular florets. The conspicu-\\nous flowers bloom singly on stout, prickly stems from\\nmid-summer to autumn. Flower heads may grow to 4 in\\n(10.16 cm) across. The dark green leaves are opposite,\\nentire, lanceolate, toothed, and hairy with three promi-\\nnent veins. The narrow upper leaves are attached to the\\nstem with stalks. The lower leaves are longer, emerging\\nfrom the stem without a leaf stalk, and growing to 8 in\\n(20.32 cm) in length. The plant develops deep, slender,\\nblack roots. Echinacea propagates easily from seed or by\\nroot cuttings. However, due to its increasing popularity\\nas an herbal supplement, echinacea is numbered among\\nthe 19 medicinal plants considered at risk by the V er-\\nmont nonprofit organization United Plant Savers.\\nGeneral use\\nThree species of echinacea are useful medicinally:\\nEchinacea augustifolia, Echinacea purpurea , and Echi-\\nnacea pallida . The entire plant has numerous medicinal\\nproperties that act synergistically to good effect. Echi-\\nnacea is most often used to boost the immune system\\nand fight infection. Research has shown that echinacea\\nincreases production of interferon in the body . It is anti-\\nseptic and antimicrobial, with properties that act to in-\\ncrease the number of white blood cells available to de-\\nstroy bacteria and slow the spread of infection. As a\\ndepurative, the herbal extract cleanses and purifies the\\nbloodstream, and has been used effectively to treat boils.\\nEchinacea is vulnerary , promoting wound healing\\nthrough the action of a chemical substance in the root\\nknown as caffeic acid glycoside. As an alterative and an\\nimmuno-modulator, echinacea acts gradually to promote\\nbeneficial change in the entire system. It has also been\\nused to treat urinary infection and Candida albicans in-\\nfections . Echinacea is a febrifuge, useful in reducing\\nfevers. It is also useful in the treatment of hemorrhoids.\\nA tincture, or a strong decoction of echinacea serves as\\nan effective mouthwash for the treatment of pyorrhea\\nand gingivitis.\\nNative American plains Indians relied on echinacea\\nas an all-purpose antiseptic. The Sioux tribe valued the\\nroot as a remedy for snake bite, the Cheyenne tribe\\nchewed the root to quench thirst, and another tribe\\nwashed their hands in a decoction of echinacea to in-\\ncrease their tolerance of heat. European settlers learned\\nof the North American herb’s many uses, and soon nu-\\nmerous echinacea-based remedies were commercially\\navailable from pharmaceutical companies in the United\\nStates.

Odle\\nEczema\\nDefinition\\nEczema, also called atopic dermatitis (AD), is a\\nnoncontagious inflammation of the skin that is character-\\nistically very dry and itchy . The condition is frequently\\nrelated to some form of allergy , which may include foods\\nor inhalants.\\nDescription\\nAtopic dermatitis is sometimes described as “the\\nitch that rashes”—the scratching of the irritated areas\\nmay very well initiate the rash in some patients. The skin\\nof those affected by AD is abnormally dry because of ex-\\ncessive loss of moisture. Chronic or severe cases of it\\ncan cause the affected areas to form thick plaques\\n(patches of slightly raised skin), develop serous (watery)\\nexudates, or become infected.\\nThe areas of the body that are affected by AD tend\\nto vary with age. Children under five years old most\\ncommonly have AD, but it can occur at any age. It can be\\nmild and intermittent, or severe and chronic. Infants fre-\\nquently experience it on the face and other areas of the\\nhead. They frequently rub their heads with their hands or\\non the crib bedding. The stomach and limbs may also be-\\ncome involved. Older children commonly have the worst\\nspots on flexor surfaces, namely the inner wrists and el-\\nbows, backs of knees, and tops of ankles. The hands and\\nfeet are other common sites. The knees, elbows, hands,\\nand feet may continue to be a problem into adulthood.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nGenetic predisposition plays a large role in who will\\nget AD or other allergies. The condition is not contagious.\\nA child who has one parent with some form of allergic, or\\natopic, disease has somewhere between a 25–60% chance\\nof also experiencing allergies, whether AD or some other\\nform. There is approximately a 50–80% chance that a\\nchild of two parents with allergies will also develop some\\nform of atopy . The genetic predisposition of the individ-\\nual, combined with such factors such as early exposure to\\nstrong antigens, will determine whether and to what extent\\nthat person will develop allergies. Aside from a predispo-\\nsition to eczema, increased use of soapy detergents and\\nbaby wipes is probably responsible for higher incidence of\\nchildhood eczema as well.\\nThe hallmark sign of AD is a red, itchy rash. The\\nage of the patient determines what regions are most like-\\nly affected, as described above, but exceptions do occur.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 667'),\n",

These would include skin tests by intra-\\ndermal injection, scratch, or patch tests. There is also a\\nblood test available that measures levels of antibodies to\\nsuspected allergens. Diagnosis is generally made by the\\nappearance and location of the rash. A personal or family\\nhistory of allergy of any type, including food allergy ,\\nasthma, or hay fever also supports the diagnosis of AD.\\nOther types of dermatitis that may be described as\\neczematous include contact dermatitis , nummular der-\\nmatitis, and stasis dermatitis. The stasis type is related to\\npoor circulation, which may also be a factor in nummu-\\nlar dermatitis. These forms generally occur in older\\nadults, whereas AD is primarily a disease of children.\\nContact dermatitis can occur at any age. It results from\\nskin contact with either an irritant or an allergen. The\\narea affected is limited to the area in contact with the of-\\nfending substance.\\nT reatment\\nThe basis of treatment for AD is keeping the skin\\nmoist and clean, as well as avoiding irritants and known\\nallergens as much as possible. Further measures become\\nnecessary if the case is particularly severe, or if the skin\\nbecomes infected.\\nConventional wisdom has been that minimal bathing\\nof the patient with AD is ideal. The rationale was that\\nbathing would break down the natural oil barrier of the\\nskin and cause further drying. It actually appears now\\nthat frequent long, tepid soaks are beneficial to hydrate\\nthe very dry skin that this condition produces. Adding a\\nmuslin bag filled with milled oats or the commercially\\navailable preparation A veeno bath to the water can be\\nsoothing. The bath water should cover as much of the\\nskin as possible. W et towels may be draped around the\\nshoulders, upper trunk, and arms if they are above the\\nwater level. The face should be dabbed frequently during\\nbathing to keep it moist. The use of soap should be mini-\\nmized, and limited to very mild agents such as Cetaphil.\\nThe bath must be followed within two or three minutes\\nby a gentle patting dry , and a thick application of a water\\nbarrier ointment, such as Aquaphor, Unibase, or V ase-\\nline. Lotions are not generally recommended as they al-\\nmost universally contain alcohol, which is drying and\\nmay burn when applied. Soaking in plain water can be\\npainful during severe episodes of AD. Adding one-half\\ncup of table salt to one-half tub of water creates a normal\\nsaline solution, similar to what is naturally present in the\\ntissues, and may relieve the burning. Commercial Dome-\\nboro powder may also be helpful.\\nOne alternative to bathing is to use soaking wraps.\\nFor this method, cotton towels or other cloths are soaked\\nin tepid water, with table salt or Domeboro powder\\nadded for comfort if desired. The patient’s bed is covered\\nwith something waterproof, and the bare skin is covered\\nas thoroughly as possible with the wet wrappings. The\\nbody should then be covered by a waterproof covering to\\nslow evaporation. V inyl sheeting and plastic wrap are\\ntwo alternatives. The wraps should be left in place for as\\nlong as possible, but at least for 30 minutes, before the\\nwater barrier and any topical medications are applied.\\nEnvironmental improvement affords some relief for\\nmany patients. Pet dander and cigarette smoke are poten-\\ntial aggravating factors. Keeping these out of the home is\\nprobably for the best, but at minimum, they should not\\nbe allowed in the room of the allergic person. Clothing\\nand bedding should be 100% soft cotton, and laundered\\nin detergent with no perfumes. These items should also\\nbe washed before the initial use in order to rid them of\\npotentially irritating residues. Clothes should fit loosely\\nto prevent irritation from rubbing. W ashing bedding in\\nhot water will help to kill dust mites. Running laundry\\nthrough a double rinse cycle will help to remove any ves-\\ntiges of detergent. A voiding the use of fabric softener or\\ndryer sheets helps, as these are frequently scented and\\nmay be irritating. Drying clothes or bedding outdoors\\nshould be avoided, because pollen and other potential al-\\nlergens are likely to cling to them. Mattresses and pil-\\nlowcase can be covered by special casings that are im-\\npervious to the microscopic dust mites that infest them.\\nUnder normal circumstances, these mites cause no prob-\\nlem, but they can be a major irritant for the individual\\nwith asthma or AD.\\nT emperature extremes can make AD worse, so heat-\\ning and cooling should be employed as appropriate,\\nalong with adding humidity if needed. Patients tend to\\nhave abnormal regulation of body temperature, and\\nsometimes feel warmer or colder than other people in\\nsimilar circumstances. Sweating will frequently aggra-\\nvate AD. Room temperature should be adjusted for com-\\nfort. Central air conditioning is the best option for cool-\\ning the home. Evaporative cooling brings a large amount\\nof potential irritants into the house, as do open windows.\\nAir conditioning rather than open windows should also\\nbe used to cool the car . Electrostatic filters and vent cov-\\ners are available to remove irritants from the air in the\\nhouse. These should be frequently changed or cleaned as\\nrecommended by the manufacturer.\\nIn the patient’s room, dust-collecting items such as\\ncurtains, carpeting, and stuffed animals are best mini-\\nmized. V acuuming and dusting should be done regularly\\nwhen the affected person is not in the room.

It is impor-\\ntant to keep fingernails short. Using a nail file will pro-\\nduce a smoother nail edge than scissors or clippers. It is\\nparticularly difficult to keep children from scratching ir-\\nritated and itchy skin, but using pajamas and clothing\\nwith maximum skin coverage will help to protect the\\nbare skin from fingernails. Mittens or socks may be used\\nto cover the hands at night to reduce the effects of\\nscratching. Infant gowns with hand coverings are useful\\nfor the very young patient.\\nIn addition to the skin care and environmental mea-\\nsures to relieve eczema, there are some complementary\\ntherapies that may prove helpful.\\nAcupuncture\\nAny type of therapy that relieves stress can also\\nhelp to manage AD. Acupuncturists also claim to be able\\nto treat blood and energy deficiencies, and to counteract\\nthe effects of detrimental elements, including heat,\\ndampness, and wind.\\nAutogenic training\\nAutogenic training is similar to methods of medita-\\ntion and self-hypnosis. Instructors help the patient to\\nachieve and maintain a relaxed state of positive concen-\\ntration. This is eventually done independently . Even ten\\nminutes of practice per day can produce beneficial re-\\nsults for mind and body . Research has shown AD to be\\none of the conditions that is improved by this technique.\\nAromatherapy/massage\\nMassage is another therapy that can be effective in\\nreducing stress. The oils that are used in the treatment\\ncan also make a difference in AD. Some patients get re-\\nlief from the topical use of evening primrose oil (EPO)\\ndiluted in carrier oil. Aromatherapists may use small\\namounts of essential oils from lavender, bergamot, and\\ngeranium. These are promoted to decrease both itching\\nand inflammation. Improper dilutions, however, can\\nworsen the condition.\\nHerbal therapy\\nSome herbal therapies can be useful for skin condi-\\ntions. Among the herbs most often recommended are:\\n• Calendula ( Calendula officinalis) ointment, for anti-in-\\nflammatory and antiseptic properties.\\n• Chickweed ( Stellaria media ) ointment, to soothe itch-\\ning.\\n• Evening primrose oil ( Oenograceae ) topically to re-\\nlieve itching, and internally to supplement fatty acids.\\n• German chamomile (Chamomilla recutita ) ointment,\\nfor anti-inflammatory properties.\\n• Nettle ( Urtica dioica) ointment, to relieve itching.\\n• Peppermint ( Menta piperita ) lotion, for antibacterial\\nand antiseptic properties.\\n• Chinese herbal medicine. In traditional Chinese med-\\nicine, there are formulas used to treat eczema that nour-\\nish the blood, moisten the skin, stop itching, and en-\\ncourage healing.

The circulatory system\\ntransports fluid within the body via its network of\\nblood vessels. The fluid, which contains oxygen and\\nnutrients needed by the cells, moves from the walls of\\nthe blood vessels into the body’s tissues. After its nutri-\\nents are used up, fluid moves back into the blood ves-\\nsels and returns to the heart. The lymphatic system (a\\nnetwork of channels in the body that carry lymph, a\\ncolorless fluid containing white blood cells to fight in-\\nfection) also absorbs and transports this fluid. In\\nedema, either too much fluid moves from the blood\\nvessels into the tissues, or not enough fluid moves from\\nthe tissues back into the blood vessels. This fluid im-\\nbalance can cause mild to severe swelling in one or\\nmore parts of the body .\\nCauses & symptoms\\nMany ordinary factors can upset the balance of fluid\\nin the body to cause edema, including:\\n• Immobility . The leg muscles normally contract and\\ncompress blood vessels to promote blood flow with\\nwalking or running. When these muscles are not used,\\nblood can collect in the veins, making it difficult for\\nfluid to move from tissues back into the vessels.\\n• Heat. W arm temperatures cause the blood vessels to ex-\\npand, making it easier for fluid to cross into surrounding\\ntissues. High humidity also aggravates this situation.\\n• Medications. Certain drugs, such as steroids, hormone\\nreplacements, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\\n(NSAIDs), and some blood pressure medications may\\naffect how fast fluid leaves blood vessels.\\n• Intake of salty foods. The body needs a constant con-\\ncentration of salt in its tissues. When excess salt is\\ntaken in, the body dilutes it by retaining fluid.\\n• Menstruation and pregnancy . The changing levels of\\nhormones affect the rate at which fluid enters and\\nleaves the tissues.\\nSome medical conditions may also cause edema, in-\\ncluding:\\n• Heart failure. When the heart is unable to maintain ade-\\nquate blood flow throughout the circulatory system, the\\nexcess fluid pressure within the blood vessels can cause\\nshifts into the interstitial spaces. Left-sided heart fail-\\nure can cause pulmonary edema, as fluid shifts into the\\nlungs. The patient may develop rapid, shallow respira-\\ntions, shortness of breath, and a cough . Right-sided\\nheart failure can cause pitting edema, a swelling in the\\ntissue under the skin of the lower legs and feet. Press-\\ning this tissue with a finger tip leads to a noticeable\\nmomentary indentation.\\n• Kidney disease. The decrease in sodium and water ex-\\ncretion can result in fluid retention and overload.\\n• Thyroid or liver disease. These conditions can change\\nthe concentration of protein in the blood, affecting fluid\\nmovement in and out of the tissues. In advanced liver\\ndisease, the liver is enlarged and fluid may build up in\\nthe abdomen.\\n• Malnutrition. Protein levels are decreased in the blood,\\nand in an effort to maintain a balance of concentrations,\\nfluid shifts out of the vessels and causes edema in tis-\\nsue spaces.\\nSome conditions that may cause swelling in just one\\nleg include:\\n• Blood clots. Clots can cause pooling of fluid and may\\nbe accompanied by discoloration and pain. In some in-\\nstances, clots may cause no pain.\\n• W eakened veins. V aricose veins, or veins whose walls\\nor valves are weak, can allow blood to pool in the legs.\\nThis is a common condition.\\n• Infection and inflammation. Infection in leg tissues can\\ncause inflammation and increasing blood flow to the\\narea. Inflammatory diseases, such as gout or arthritis,\\ncan also result in swelling.\\n• Lymphedema. Blocked lymph channels may be caused\\nby infection, scar tissue, or hereditary conditions.\\nLymph that can’t drain properly results in edema. Lym-\\nphedema may also occur after cancer treatments, when\\nthe lymph system is impaired by surgery , radiation, or\\nchemotherapy .\\n• Tumor. Abnormal masses can compress leg vessels and\\nlymph channels, affecting the rate of fluid movement.\\nSymptoms vary depending on the cause of edema.\\nIn general, weight gain, puffy eyelids, and swelling of\\nthe legs may occur as a result of excess fluid volume.\\nPulse rate and blood pressure may be elevated.

The Roman naturalist Pliny wrote about the\\ntherapeutic value of this flowering tree in the first century\\nA.D. Native Americans used elder as a treatment for respi-\\nratory infections and constipation as well as an herbal\\npad for healing wounds. Black elder (Sambucus nigra) is\\nthe most popular variety of the plant, though there are\\nother species known to have similar chemical ingredients.\\nElder grows in Europe, Asia, North Africa, and the Unit-\\ned States. Most medicinal elder is obtained from the for-\\nmer Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the United King-\\ndom. The Latin word sambucus is thought to be derived\\nfrom the Greek sambuca, which refers to a stringed musi-\\ncal instrument popular among the Ancient Romans. In\\nfact, some modern day Italians still make a primitive pipe\\ncalled a sampogna from the branches of the tree, which\\nalso produces fragrant, cream-colored flowers and deep-\\nviolet berries. The flowers and berries are used most\\noften in the drug of commerce, though the leaves, bark,\\nand roots are also considered to have therapeutic effects.\\nThe berries traditionally have been used to make elder-\\nberry wine as well as pies and jellies, although no value\\nhas yet been found in these products.\\nThe German Commission E, considered an authorita-\\ntive source of information on alternative remedies, deter-\\nmined that elder has the ability to increase bronchial secre-\\ntions as well as perspiration. These properties can be useful\\nin helping to alleviate symptoms of the common cold or\\nthe flu. Even more interesting is the possibility that elder,\\nlike another herbal remedy called echinacea, may have the\\npower to shorten the duration of colds by up to a few days.\\nWhile it is not known exactly how elder produces its thera-\\npeutic effects, study has focused on several naturally occur-\\nring chemicals in the plant. Elder’s flavonoids and phenolic\\nacids are thought to be responsible for its ability to increase\\nperspiration. The triterpenes in elder may also be potential\\n“active ingredients, ” though more study is required to con-\\nfirm this. The remaining chemical constituents of medicinal\\nelder usually include potassiumand other minerals; sterols;\\nOther alternative treatments\\nOther alternative therapies may also reduce edema.\\nThey include traditional Chinese medicine , A yurveda,\\njuice therapy , and bodywork. Traditional Chinese medi-\\ncine and acupuncture have an elaborate diagnostic sys-\\ntem to determine the pattern causing the edema. Thus\\ntreatment, if done correctly , results not only in the removal\\nof fluid, but also with the correction of the problem.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThe three “Ds”—diuretics, digitalis, and diet—are\\nfrequently prescribed for medical conditions that result\\nin excess fluid volume. Diuretics are medications that\\npromote urination of sodium and water. Digoxin is a dig-\\nitalis preparation that is sometimes needed to decrease\\nheart rate and increase the strength of the heart’s contrac-\\ntions. One dietary recommendation includes less sodium\\nin order to decrease fluid retention. Consideration of ad-\\nequate protein intake is also made.\\nFor patients with lymphedema, a combination of\\ntherapies may prove effective. Combined decongestive\\ntherapy includes the use of manual lymph drainage\\n(MLD), compression bandaging, garments and pumps,\\nand physical therapy .\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nThe Burton Goldberg Group. “Edema. ” in Alternative Medi-\\ncine: The Definitive Guide.

The au-\\nthors of the study recommended elder as a possible treat-\\nment for influenza A and B based on the herbal remedy’s\\neffectiveness, lack of side effects, and low cost. By way of\\ncomparison, over-the-counter synthetic drugs may offer\\nsome measure of symptomatic relief for a cold but have\\nnot been proven to actually speed recovery .

It has also been used topically as an herbal\\npad to reduce external swelling and heal wounds. Some\\nwomen have used elder to increase the amount of milk\\nproduced during breastfeeding. However, as of early 2000,\\nsufficient scientific evidence to support these additional\\nuses is lacking. While elder has been used as a folk reme-\\ndy for treating diabetes, studies in rodents suggest that it\\nhas no effects on blood sugar regulation.\\nPreparations\\nDosage of elder generally ranges from 10-15 g per\\nday , divided into three equal doses. The drug, which is\\nrecommended for internal use only , is usually taken as a\\ntea or liquid extract. Elder tea can be prepared by steeping\\n3-4 g (2 teaspoonfuls) of dried elder flower in 150 ml of\\nhot (not boiling) water. The mixture should be strained\\nafter about 5 minutes. The tea works best when it is con-\\nsumed at a temperature as hot as can be safely tolerated.\\nDosage is several cups of tea a day (do not exceed the\\ndaily maximum of 15 g of elder), taken in the afternoons\\nand evenings. When using a standardized liquid extract of\\nelder, follow the package directions for proper use.\\nPrecautions\\nT aken in recommended dosages, elder is not known\\nto be harmful. It should be used with caution in children,\\nwomen who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and people\\nwith kidney or liver disorders because its effects in these\\ngroups have not been sufficiently studied.\\nBe careful not to confuse black elder with a more\\ntoxic species of the plant called dwarf elder ( Sambucus\\nebulus ). Dwarf elder is generally not recommended for\\nmedical purposes and may cause vomiting and diarrhea\\nin large dosages.\\nSide effects\\nSide effects are considered rare.

Electroacupuncture was\\ndeveloped in 1958 in China, when acupuncturists there\\nbegan experimenting with it as surgical anesthesia, or\\npain control. After several years of testing during\\nsurgery , acupuncturists began applying electroacupunc-\\nture in clinical practice for many conditions.\\nBenefits\\nElectroacupuncture can be used to treat the same va-\\nriety of health conditions that regular acupuncture treats,\\nand for conditions that do not respond to conventional\\nacupuncture. It is effectively used as surgical anesthesia,\\nas a means of reducing chronic pain and muscle spasms,\\nand as a treatment for neurological (nerve) disorders.\\nDescription\\nAcupuncturists begin treatment by diagnosing a pa-\\ntient. Diagnosis is performed with interviews, close ex-\\naminations (such as of the tongue and pulse diagnosis ),\\nand other methods. Acupuncture strives to balance and\\nimprove the flow of chi, or life energy , which travels\\nthroughout the body in channels called meridians . Ac-\\ncording to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), illness\\nis caused when chi does not move properly in the body .\\nAcupuncturists are trained to determine where chi is stag-\\nnated, weak, or out of balance, which indicates where and\\nhow acupuncture points on the body should be stimulat-\\ned. Electroacupuncture is often recommended for cases\\nof accumulation of chi, such as in chronic pain, and in\\ncases where the chi is difficult to prompt or stimulate.\\nPatients usually lie down for acupuncture treatment.\\nThin, sterilized needles are used, and the surface of the\\nskin where they will be inserted is sterilized, as well.\\nOne advantage of electroacupuncture is that the margin\\nof error for needle placement is greater than for regular\\nacupuncture, because the electrical current stimulates a\\nlarger area around the needle. Electroacupuncture works\\nwith two needles at a time in order for electrical current\\nto pass through the body from one needle to another.\\nSmall devices are used to create and regulate a pulsing\\nelectric charge, which is sent to the needles by attaching\\nsmall clips to their ends. The electric charge is very\\nsmall, and can be adjusted by the acupuncturist or pa-\\ntient. Both the voltage (intensity) and the frequency of\\nthe electric charge can be adjusted for healing effects.\\nV oltage levels should be raised slowly . Several pairs of\\nneedles may be stimulated at one time, for up to 30 or\\nmore minutes of electrical stimulation along the meridi-\\nans. Another similar, though conventional, medical tech-\\nnique is called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimula-\\ntion (TENS), which uses electrodes that are taped to the\\nsurface of the skin instead of attached to inserted nee-\\ndles, which may be advantageous for patients for whom\\nneedles pose risks or problems. This technique stimu-\\nlates along nerve and muscle groups.\\nPrecautions\\nElectroacupuncture should not be used on people\\nwho have seizures, epilepsy , histories of heart disease\\nor strokes, or those with heart pacemakers.

He decided to study medicine when various\\ntreatments to restore the health of his father failed. He\\nspent much of his early career specializing in tropical\\ndiseases, sports medicine, and public health, and set up\\na practice in Plochingen in southern Germany . He was\\nintroduced to methods of Chinese acupuncture by a\\ndoctor who worked in the tropics and was a firm believ-\\ner in the practice. By the 1950s, Voll was engaging in\\nthe ancient Chinese practice. He had an idea that mod-\\nern technology might enhance acupuncture in the treat-\\nment of various chronic diseases such as allergies,\\nchronic fatigue, migraines, and chronic liver , kidney or\\npancreatic diseases. His research led him to elec-\\ntroacupuncture (EAV), using electric currents to enhance\\nmanipulation of the traditional acupuncture points. In\\naddition to that, he realized that there were even more\\npoints, or meridians, that corresponded directly with\\nparticular organs. Voll then developed a system to mea-\\nsure the degree of inflammation these organs suffered.\\nVoll focused on certain criteria by which to treat\\nthese points. He determined that conditions were either\\ninflammable, chronic, or subchronic. By the use of\\nnosodes, remedies composed of bacteria or viruses, and\\nbased on the causes of those diseases and using other\\nhomeopathic agents, he was able to test for drugs before\\nthe patient ingested them. It was Voll who also discov-\\nered the relationship between teeth and the inner organs,\\nan important key to understanding health and disease.\\nThe Institute for ElectroAcupuncture & ElectroDiag-\\nnostics is based on Voll’ s original methods is located in\\nMunich, Germany .

The air sacs (alveoli) are destroyed and oxy-\\ngen uptake is restricted due to the loss of elasticity of\\nlung tissue.\\nDescription\\nAs of 1998 there were an estimated two million peo-\\nple suffering from emphysema in America. Between\\nthree and five percent were attributed to genetic factors,\\nthe remainder being a result of environmental pollution,\\nwith smoking ranking far and away as the main cause.\\nNormally functioning lungs are elastic, and effi-\\nciently expand and recoil as air passes freely through\\ntheir passageways (bronchus) to the alveoli, where oxy-\\ngen is moved into the blood and carbon dioxide is fil-\\ntered out. When a person inhales cigarette smoke or air-\\nborne pollutants, his or her immune system responds by\\nreleasing substances that are meant to defend the lungs\\nagainst the smoke. These substances can also attack the\\ncells of the lungs, but the body normally inhibits such\\naction with the release of other substances.\\nWhen individuals are exposed to pollution over a\\nlong period of time the lung tissue is damaged in such a\\nway that it loses its elasticity . When damage has occurred\\nto the alveoli, sufferers have difficulty making a complete\\nexhalation, which causes residual volume—air trapped\\ninside the lungs.

The practitioner aims to\\nstimulate relevant meridians in the body , and so release\\ntrapped life force, returning bodily functions to normal.\\nThe treatment is virtually painless.\\nTreatment can be expected to improve blood circula-\\ntion and the capacity of the body to restore itself. Research\\nhas indicated that acupuncture can produce changes in\\nthe electrical fields of body cells, promoting a return to the\\nbody’s normal state. Consequently , few negative side ef-\\nfects are associated with acupuncture treatment.\\nBreathing techniques\\nV ery few people actually breathe correctly , and if\\nlung function is not up to par, the difference between\\nbreathing fully and taking shallow ineffective, breaths can\\nmake a remarkable difference in the way a person feels\\nand the way his or her body functions. Oxygen shortage in\\nthe body promotes disease, and ensuring that oxygen lev-\\nels are kept up can avert disaster, even with the existence\\nof lung-impairment. Improved breathing techniques can\\nrid the body of free radicals, neutralize environmental tox-\\nins, and destroy many harmful microbes that cannot exist\\nin an oxygen-rich environment. Without sufficient oxy-\\ngen, the body cannot fully utilize nutrients from food, and\\nbodily functions generally become less efficient. Every ef-\\nfort must be made to promote proper breathing,in order to\\noffset the effects of reduced lung function.\\nIn cases of emphysema, it is particularly important to\\nensure that the out-breath expels all of the previous in-\\nbreath. When exhalation is incomplete, wastes produced by\\nbreathing are not expelled from the body in the normal way ,\\nand residual volume, which is a common occurrence with\\nprogressive emphysema, may cause chest enlargement.\\nHomeopathy\\nHomeopathy is the treatment of illness according to\\na system of “like cures like” that stimulates the body to\\nheal itself. While it could definitely contribute to the suc-\\ncessful treatment of emphysema, Homeopathy requires a\\nqualified practitioner, as the patient’s condition must be\\naccurately assessed in order that the correct remedy be\\nprescribed. Even for the same disorder, no two patients\\nwill receive the same treatment.\\nLifestyle\\nFor lung dysfunction of any kind, it is vital to take\\nsteps to ensure that a person’s lifestyle is not contributing\\nto the problem. Pollution must be avoided at all costs, and\\nsteps should be taken to ensure that the living environ-\\nment is free of chemical irritants. This may involve avoid-\\ning fragrances, as they can overburden damaged lungs.\\nSome unscented products use a masking fragrance which\\nonly increases toxicity . Common household products,\\nsuch as fabric softeners, bleach, scented detergents, and\\nfurniture polish, can harm the body and the environment.\\nIt must be noted that pesticides, fungicides, herbi-\\ncides, and fertilizers are all neurotoxins, (poisonous to\\nthe nervous system). Natural alternatives are obtainable\\nfor most household cleaning products. Personal care\\nproducts can also cause damage, so only natural sources\\nshould be used. Chlorinated pools should be avoided.\\nEvery effort should be made to obtain food that is\\norganically grown, in order to avoid pesticides and\\nchemicals.

Like the\\nuterine lining, this tissue builds up and sheds in response\\nto monthly hormonal cycles. The blood discarded from\\nthese implants falls onto surrounding organs, causing\\nswelling and inflammation. This repeated irritation leads\\nto the development of scar tissue and adhesions.\\nDescription\\nEndometriosis is estimated to affect 7% of women\\nof childbearing age in the United States. It most com-\\nmonly strikes between the ages of 25 and 40. En-\\ndometriosis can also appear in the teen years, but never\\nbefore the start of menstruation . It is seldom seen in\\npostmenopausal women.\\nEndometriosis was once called the “career woman’s\\ndisease” because it was thought to be a product of de-\\nlayed childbearing. The statistics defy such a narrow\\ngeneralization; however, pregnancy may slow the\\nprogress of the condition. W omen whose periods last\\nlonger than a week with an interval of less than 27 days\\nbetween them seem to be more prone to the condition.\\nEndometrial implants are most often found on the\\npelvic organs, including the ovaries, uterus, fallopian\\ntubes, and in the cavity behind the uterus. Occasionally ,\\nthis tissue grows in such distant parts of the body as the\\nlungs, arms, and kidneys. Ovarian cysts may form\\naround endometrial tissue (endometriomas) and may\\nrange from pea to grapefruit size. Endometriosis is a pro-\\ngressive condition that usually advances slowly over the\\ncourse of many years. Doctors rank cases from minimal\\nto severe based on factors such as the number and size of\\nthe endometrial implants, their appearance and location,\\nand the extent of the scar tissue and adhesions in the\\nvicinity of the growths.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAlthough the exact cause of endometriosis is un-\\nknown, a number of theories have been put forward.\\nSome of the more popular ones are:\\n• Implantation theory . This theory states that a reversal in\\nthe direction of menstrual flow sends discarded en-\\ndometrial cells into the body cavity where they attach\\nto internal organs and seed endometrial implants. There\\nis considerable evidence to support this explanation.\\nReversed menstrual flow occurs in 70-90% of women\\nand is thought to be more common in women with en-\\ndometriosis.\\n• V ascular-lymphatic theory . This theory suggests that\\nthe lymph system or blood vessels (vascular system)\\nare the vehicles for distribution of endometrial cells out\\nof the uterus.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 683'),\n",

(Cus-\\ntom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)\\nlation between the severity of the symptoms and the ex-\\ntent of the disease. The most common symptoms are:\\n• Menstrual pain. Pain in the lower abdomen that begins a\\nday or two before the menstrual period starts and contin-\\nues until the end is typical of endometriosis. Some women\\nalso report lower back aches, and pain during urination\\nand bowel movement, especially during their periods.\\n• Painful sexual intercourse. Pressure on the vagina and\\ncervix causes severe pain for some women.\\n• Abnormal bleeding. Heavy menstrual periods, irregular\\nbleeding, and spotting are common features of en-\\ndometriosis.\\n• Infertility . There is a strong association between en-\\ndometriosis and infertility , although the reasons for this\\nhave not been fully explained. It is thought that the\\nbuild-up of scar tissue and adhesions blocks the fallopian\\ntubes and prevents the ovaries from releasing eggs. En-\\ndometriosis may also affect fertility by causing hormon-\\nal irregularities and a higher rate of early miscarriage.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe first step is to perform a pelvic exam to try to\\nfeel if implants are present. V ery often there is no strong\\nevidence of endometriosis from a physical exam. The\\nonly way to make a definitive diagnosis is through minor\\nsurgery called a laparoscopy . A laparoscope, a slender\\nscope with a light on the end, is inserted into the\\nwoman’s abdomen through a small incision near her\\nbelly button. This allows the doctor to examine the inter-\\nnal organs. Often, a sample of tissue is taken for later ex-\\namination in the laboratory . Endometriosis is sometimes\\ndiscovered when a woman has abdominal surgery for an-\\nother reason such as tubal ligation or hysterectomy .\\nV arious imaging techniques such as ultrasound,\\ncomputed tomography scan (CT scan), or magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI) can offer additional information\\nbut aren’t useful in making the initial diagnosis. A blood\\ntest may also be ordered because women with en-\\ndometriosis have higher levels of the blood protein\\nCA125. T esting for this substance before and after treat-\\nment can predict a recurrence of the disease, but is not\\nreliable as a diagnostic tool.\\nT reatment\\nAlthough severe endometriosis should not be self-\\ntreated, many women find they can help relieve symp-\\ntoms through alternative therapies. In a survey conducted\\nby the Endometriosis Association, 40-60% of the women\\nwho used alternative medicines reported relief of pain\\nand other symptoms.\\n• Coelomic metaplasia theory . According to this hypoth-\\nesis, remnants of tissue left over from prenatal develop-\\nment of the woman’s reproductive tract transform into\\nendometrial cells throughout the body .\\n• Induction theory . This explanation postulates that an\\nunidentified substance found in the body forces cells\\nfrom the lining of the body cavity to change into en-\\ndometrial cells.\\nIn addition to these theories, the following factors\\nare thought to influence the development of endometrio-\\nsis:\\n• Heredity . A woman’s chance of developing en-\\ndometriosis is seven times greater if her mother or sis-\\nters have the disease.\\n• Immune system function. W omen with endometriosis\\nmay have lower functioning immune systems that have\\ntrouble eliminating stray endometrial cells. This would\\nexplain why a high percentage of women experience\\nreversed menstrual flow while relatively few develop\\nendometriosis.\\n• Dioxin exposure. Some research suggests a link be-\\ntween the exposure to dioxin (TCCD), a toxic chemical\\nfound in weed killers, and the development of en-\\ndometriosis.\\nWhile many women with endometriosis suffer de-\\nbilitating symptoms, others have the disease without\\nknowing it.

In the W est, as early as\\nthe sixth century B.C., Pythagoras conceived of a life en-\\nergy , or pneuma, visible in a luminous body . A century\\nlater, Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine, recog-\\nnized the body’s natural capacity for healing, or V is med-\\nicatrix naturae . He instructed physicians to find the\\nblocking influences both within a patient and between\\nthem and the cosmos, in order to restore the healing life\\nforce. Nature, not the doctor, is the source of healing.\\nIn the sixteenth century , the Swiss alchemist and\\nphysician Paracelsus reported “a healing energy that ra-\\ndiates within and around man like a luminous sphere. ”\\nHe believed this energy could cause and cure disease and\\ncould work from a distance. He also thought that mag-\\nnets, planets, and stars could influence this energy . There\\nare echoes of these beliefs in some theories and practices\\nof contemporary energy medicine. However, the ideas of\\nFrancis Bacon and the French philosopher and mathe-\\nmatician René Descartes have had a much greater impact\\non W estern medicine as a whole.\\nBacon applied logical mathematical concepts to an-\\nalyze humans and the world. He believed that the laws of\\nscience should be used to “master rather than become\\nharmonious with nature. ” Descartes proposed that the\\nbody , which was measurable, and the mind, which was\\nimmeasurable, were firmly separate. The body could in-\\nfluence the mind but the mind could not influence the\\nbody . These notions promoted the search for physical\\ncauses of human illness. They also led to a denial of the\\nmind’s ability to affect physical health. As a result, main-\\nstream science came to devalue or reject any phenome-\\nnon that cannot be measured or objectively proved.\\nFrom the seventeenth century onward, W estern\\nmedicine has focused primarily upon the physical as-\\npects of disease. Scientists who studied forces within the\\nbody that were difficult to measure were often ignored or\\nridiculed. The Austrian psychiatrist Wilhelm Reich, who\\nhad been a student and colleague of Sigmund Freud, was\\njailed and his books publicly burned because of his theo-\\nries about “orgone” energy . His views, however, have in-\\nfluenced the development of many body-mind approach-\\nes, particularly bioenergetics.\\nThe 1990s brought a new emerging scientific para-\\ndigm in relation to medicine and health care. According\\nto biophysicist Beverly Rubik, this emerging paradigm\\n“… celebrates the creative, subtle, empowering, wise,\\nand enduring features of life that were never acknowl-\\nedged during the age of machines and mechanistic\\nthought. Living systems are self-organizing systems that\\nexpend energy in order to maintain their coherence and\\nintegrity ...Healing is ultimately self-healing, a natural re-\\nsponse to internal dynamic shifts or external challenges. ”\\nThis new paradigm also conveys that “...very small or\\nsubtle stimuli applied to the body-mind can have pro-\\nfound effects and set a person on the road to recovery . ”\\nBenefits\\nIn a 1990 review of more than 131 controlled scien-\\ntific studies of healers from around the world, Dr. Daniel\\nBenor found evidence of healing for a wide range of\\nhuman conditions. These include changes in immune\\nsystem functioning as well as improvement of skin-\\nwound healing, blood pressure, nearsightedness,\\nleukemia , anxiety , asthma , bronchitis , epilepsy , ten-\\nsion headache, neck and back pain, post-operative pain,\\nself-esteem, heart disease, and relationships.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 687\\nEnergy medicine\\nCaroline Myss graduated with a B.A. in Journalism\\nin 1974 from St. Mary of the Woods College in T erre\\nHaute, Indiana.

Some methods can be applied\\nfrom a distance, others require attendance at a ceremony\\nand may include family and friends. The movement\\nmodalities may require learning and practicing a particu-\\nlar movement or breath sequence.

Randolph, M.D., who was a trained specialist in inter-\\nnal medicine, immunology , and allergies . Several\\ndecades ago, Randolph became concerned with chroni-\\ncally ill patients who had symptoms of allergies and im-\\nmune system disorders, but didn’t respond to conven-\\ntional medical care. Randolph believed that patients\\nwere getting sick from environmental substances and\\npollutants that allergy specialists could not determine or\\ndid not recognize as causing illness. Conventional aller-\\ngy specialists in Randolph’ s time believed that allergies\\ncould only be detected by measuring the response of im-\\nmunoglobulin E (IgE). IgE is a particular antibody pro-\\nduced by the immune system when an antigen (foreign\\nsubstance) triggers a reaction. Randolph believed that\\ntesting for allergies using only this technique limited the\\ndetermination of immune system problems. Using other\\ntests and techniques, he found that many substances that\\ndidn’t necessarily cause increased amounts of IgE could\\ncreate allergic symptoms and complications in the body .\\nResearch has since shown that food allergies cause in-\\ncreases in immunoglobulin G (IgG) and not in IgE. Sci-\\nfactors—so many , in fact, that it is virtually impossible\\nto establish a repeatable experiment in which all would\\noccur in the same combination more than once...W e will\\nhave to be content with our human limitations and settle\\nfor approximate results, measured in probabilities over\\nlarge numbers of trials. No apologies are needed. These\\nare the limitations of healing. ”\\nT raining & certification\\nThere is no course of training leading to certification\\nor licensure for energy medicine as such. V arious schools\\nof touch and movement therapy, as well as energy heal-\\ning, offer their own forms of certification. The require-\\nments vary according to each modality and each school.\\nSpiritual healers may be certified through a school of en-\\nergy healing, recognized within a particular religious tra-\\ndition for their healing aptitude, or initiated into healing\\nby another means. Many healers develop their healing\\ngifts on their own. The evidence suggests that any caring\\nperson can develop a certain amount of healing ability\\nthrough meditation, prayer, study with other experienced\\nhealers, and practice.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBecker, Robert O., et al.

Randolph determined that envi-\\nronmental agents could cause mental and behavioral dis-\\nturbances as well as physical symptoms. Randolph and\\nother doctors developed and used new diagnostic tech-\\nniques, including intradermal (between skin layers) and\\nsublingual (under the tongue) allergy tests, to determine\\nexactly which environmental factors were influencing\\nillnesses. Environmental doctors were able to heal many\\npatients, simply by removing certain foods and chemi-\\ncals from their environments.\\nRandolph went on to dedicate his work to studying\\nthe interaction between patients and their environments.\\nHe and his colleagues called this new field of medicine\\nclinical ecology , which was later changed to environ-\\nmental medicine. The field’s basic ideas are that doctors\\nmust consider both the patient and the patient’s environ-\\nment in treatment, and that there are cause and effect re-\\nlationships between environmental factors and illness.\\nEnvironmental factors include food, air, water, living\\narrangements, and workplace environments. For illness-\\nes that are caused by exposure to negative environmental\\nfactors, healing can be induced not by drugs, but by test-\\ning for and removing the environmental causes of illness\\nand by strengthening the patient’s resistance.\\nEnvironmental therapists have isolated many sub-\\nstances that cause illness and adverse reactions in people,\\nincluding chemicals, car exhaust, tobacco smoke, pesti-\\ncides, drugs, food additives, and common allergens like\\ndust, mold, animal dander, and pollen. Many people may\\nalso have allergic and negative reactions to common\\nfoods such as dairy products, corn syrup, sugar, wheat,\\ncertain fruits and vegetables, nuts, and meat. Exposure to\\ntoxic and allergenic substances may exert a cumulative\\neffect on the body , weakening and taxing the immune\\nsystem over time so that the body becomes hypersensitive\\n(more susceptible) to substances that were once tolerated.\\nIn 2002, a Harvard University study demonstrated that\\nglobal warming was adding to the presence of airborne al-\\nlergens like ragweed pollen. Atmospheric carbon dioxide\\nconcentration is up 29 percent since industrial times began\\nand is expected to double again in the next 50 to 100 years.\\nThe heavy carbon dioxide concentration helps plants grow\\nfaster and larger, producing more allergens.\\nEnvironmental medicine has become increasingly\\npopular in the last few decades as the public has become\\nmore aware of environmental pollution. Every year,\\nmore than 700,000 different chemicals are released into\\nthe environment, and the figure has been growing by\\n10% or more per year. T oxic or allergenic chemicals can\\nbe found in everything from common household materi-\\nals like carpet and furniture to basic items like food and\\nwater. Environmental therapists believe that new medical\\nproblems have arisen due to the immune system’s inabil-\\nity to handle all of the new pollutants and synthetic\\nchemicals to which it is exposed. Environmental illness\\nis the cumulative effect of lengthy or constant exposure\\nto these toxins. Those with environmental illness become\\nhypersensitive to even minute quantities of common ma-\\nterials. Environmental hypersensitivity can cause severe\\ndisability in many people.\\nEnvironmental medicine recognizes that some new\\nand baffling illnesses have appeared that conventional\\nmedicine either does not recognize or is unable to treat,\\nsometimes called “twentieth century diseases. ” These\\nconditions include environmental illness/multiple chemi-\\ncal sensitivity (EI/MCS), chronic fatigue syndrome , fi-\\nbromyalgia , Gulf W ar syndrome , and sick building\\nsyndrome . Furthermore, diseases for which environ-\\nmental causes are believed to be major factors are also\\nincreasing (like cancer and asthma ), making environ-\\nmental medicine increasingly important.\\nBenefits\\nEnvironmental medicine is helpful for those patients\\nsuffering from chronic allergies, asthma, chronic fatigue\\nsyndrome, EI/MCS, fibromyalgia, Gulf W ar syndrome,\\nand sick building syndrome. It is helpful for those with\\nconditions that are influenced by environmental factors,\\nsuch as cancer, as well as for those who have been ex-\\nposed to high levels of toxic materials due to accident or\\noccupation. Environmental medicine is also used for\\npeople suffering allergic or immune system problems\\nthat conventional medicine is unable to diagnose or treat.\\nSymptoms for those suffering environmental illness in-\\nclude unexplained fatigue, increased allergies, hypersen-\\nsitivity to common materials, intolerance to certain foods\\nand indigestion , aches and pains, low-grade fever ,\\nheadaches, insomnia , depression , sore throats, sudden\\nweight loss or gain, lowered resistance to infection, gen-\\neral malaise, and disability .\\nDescription\\nEnvironmental therapy treats patients by first identi-\\nfying the environmental causes of illness.

Cleansing and detoxifying\\nthe body of toxic substances and supporting overall\\n(holistic) healing and recovery are the other components\\nof the treatment process.\\nThe cost of treatment by a practitioner of environ-\\nmental medicine can vary depending on the education of\\nthe practitioner. Costs are generally comparable to visits\\nto trained medical specialists. Practitioners may be con-\\nventionally trained medical doctors, researchers with\\ngraduate degrees in environmental medicine, or alterna-\\ntive medicine practitioners such as homeopaths,\\nA yurvedic medicine practitioners, traditional Chinese\\nmedicine practitioners, and naturopaths. Treatment costs\\nvary , depending on the type and number of tests required\\nto identify problems and the subsequent healing thera-\\npies required. Many insurance policies cover costs of en-\\nvironmental therapy , particularly when the practitioner is\\na certified medical doctor. Consumers should be aware\\nof their insurance company’s policies on coverage.\\nDiagnosing environmental illness\\nEnvironmental therapists use extensive testing to de-\\ntermine the environmental factors that may be causing\\nillness. These factors include infection, allergy , addic-\\ntions, and toxic chemicals. Infections that often plague\\nthose with environmental illness can be caused by para-\\nsites, bacteria, viruses, and yeast. Blood, urine, stool,\\nand hair analyses are used to measure a variety of bodily\\nfunctions that may indicate problems. Environmental\\ntherapists have access to laboratories that specialize in\\nsophisticated blood, urine, and other diagnostic tests.\\nIn testing for environmental illness, liver function is\\nstudied closely because the liver is the principle organ in\\nthe body responsible for removing toxic compounds. An-\\nother useful blood test is a test for zinc deficiency , which\\nmay indicate heavy metal poisoning . Heavy metal poi-\\nsoning can be caused by lead, mercury , arsenic, cadmi-\\num, and aluminum, all of which are present in the envi-\\nronment. Hair analysis is also used to test for heavy\\nmetal toxicity . Blood and urine tests can also be com-\\npleted that screen for toxic chemicals such as PCBs (en-\\nvironmental poisons), formaldehyde (a common preserv-\\native), pesticides, and heavy metals. Immune system\\ntests, which show levels of particular antibodies, can also\\nindicate specific environmental factors. Hormone levels\\nalso may indicate environmental illness. Certain blood\\nand urine tests may suggest nutritional deficiencies and\\nproper recovery diets can be designed for patients.\\nEnvironmental therapists also perform extensive al-\\nlergy and hypersensitivity tests. Intradermal and sublin-\\ngual allergy tests are used to determine a patient’s sensi-\\ntivity to a variety of common substances, including\\nformaldehyde, auto exhaust, perfume, tobacco, chlorine,\\njet fuel, and other chemicals.\\nFood allergies require additional tests because these\\nallergies often have reactions that are delayed for several\\ndays after eating the food. The RAST (radioallergosor-\\nbent test) is a blood test that determines the level of im-\\nmunoglobulins in the blood after specific foods are\\neaten. The cytotoxic test is a blood test that determines\\nwhether certain substances affect blood cells, including\\nfoods and chemicals. The ELISA-ACT (enzyme-linked\\nimmunoserological assay activated cell test) is consid-\\nered one of the most accurate tests for allergies and hy-\\npersensitivity to foods, chemicals, and other agents.\\nOther tests for food allergies are the elimination and ro-\\ntation diets, where foods are systematically evaluated to\\nisolate those that are causing problems.\\nTherapies used in environmental medicine\\nAfter environmental causes of illness are identified,\\nthe next step is to reduce or eliminate the patient’s expo-\\nsure to them to reduce the burden on the immune system.\\nPatients are advised to immediately remove toxic and al-\\nlergic agents from the home and workplace, to make\\nlifestyle and dietary changes to reduce exposure, and to\\nimprove general physical and mental health.\\nDetoxification methods are used by alternative prac-\\ntitioners in treating environmental illnesses. These meth-\\nods try to rid the body of accumulated toxic substances\\nand to restore efficient functioning. Detoxification meth-\\nods include dietary therapies, fasting, exercise, sweating,\\nlaxatives, enemas, and other techniques that stimulate and\\nsupport the body’s natural detoxification mechanisms.\\nNutritional and herbal supplements are used in the detox-\\nification and strengthening process. These supplements\\ninclude antioxidants and vitamins, numerous herbs that\\ndetoxify the body and stimulate the immune system, and\\nenzymes to improve digestion. Natural and holistic treat-\\nments are used to rebuild and strengthen the patient’s\\noverall health and resistance. Traditional healing systems\\nsuch as traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathy ,\\nayurveda, and homeopathy may be used as therapeutic\\nprograms for environmental illness.\\nPreparations\\nPatients can assist diagnosis and treatment by keeping\\ndetailed diaries of their activities, symptoms, and contact\\nwith environmental factors that may be affecting their health.\\nSide effects\\nIf detoxification treatments are used, patients may\\nexperience side effects of fatigue, malaise, aches and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 691\\nEnvironmental therapy\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 691'),\n",

The\\nbody manufactures several thousands of enzymes.\\nAmong them are the digestive enzymes produced by the\\nstomach, pancreas, small intestine, and the salivary\\nglands of the mouth. Their energy-producing properties\\nare responsible for not only the digestion of nutrients,\\nbut their absorption, transportation, metabolization, and\\nelimination as well.\\nEnzyme therapy is based on the work of Dr. Edward\\nHowell in the 1920s and 1930s. Howell proposed that\\nenzymes from foods work in the stomach to pre-digest\\nfood. He advocated the consumption of large amounts of\\nplant enzymes, theorizing that if the body had to use less\\nof its own enzymes for digestion, it could store them for\\nmaintaining metabolic harmony . Four categories of plant\\nenzymes are helpful in pre-digestion: protease, amylase,\\nlipase, and cellulase. Cellulase is particularly helpful be-\\ncause the body is unable to produce it.\\nAnimal enzymes, such as pepsin extracted from the\\nstomach of pigs, work more effectively in the duodenum.\\nThey are typically used for the treatment of nondigestive\\nailments.\\nThe seven categories of food enzymes and their ac-\\ntivities\\n• amylase: breaks down starches\\n• cellulase: breaks down fibers\\n• lactase: breaks down dairy products\\n• lipase: breaks down fats\\n• maltase: breaks down grains\\n• protease: breaks down proteins\\n• sucrase: breaks down sugars\\nEnzyme theory generated further interest as the\\nhuman diet became more dependent on processed and\\ncooked foods. Enzymes are extremely sensitive to\\nheat, and temperatures above 118°F (48°C) destroy\\nthem. Modern processes of pasteurization, canning,\\nand microwaving are particularly harmful to the en-\\nzymes in food.\\nBenefits\\nIn traditional medicine, enzyme supplements are\\noften prescribed for patients suffering from disorders\\nthat affect the digestive process, such as cystic fibrosis,\\nGaucher’s disease, diabetes, and celiac disease . A pro-\\ngram of enzyme supplementation is rarely recommend-\\ned for healthy patients. However, proponents of enzyme\\ntherapy believe that such a program is beneficial for\\neveryone. They point to enzymes’ ability to purify the\\nblood, strengthen the immune system, enhance mental\\ncapacity , cleanse the colon, and maintain proper pH bal-\\nance in urine. They feel that by improving the digestive\\nprocess, the body is better able to combat infection and\\ndisease.\\nSome evidence exists that pancreatic enzymes de-\\nrived from animal sources are helpful in cancer treat-\\nment. The enzymes may be able to dissolve the coating\\non cancer cells and may make it easier for the immune\\nsystem to attack the cancer.\\nA partial list of the wide variety of complaints and\\nillnesses that can be treated by enzyme therapy includes:\\n• AIDS\\n• anemia\\n• alcohol consumption\\n• anxiety\\n• acute inflammation\\n• back pain\\n• cancer\\n• colds\\n• chronic fatigue syndrome\\n• colitis\\n• constipation\\n• diarrhea\\n• food allergies\\n• gastritis\\n• gastric duodenal ulcer\\n• gout\\n• headaches\\n• hepatitis\\n• hypoglycemia\\n• infections\\n• mucous congestion\\n• multiple sclerosis\\n• nervous disorders\\n• nutritional disorders\\n• obesity\\n• premenstrual syndrome (PMS)\\n• stress\\nIn 2002, a biopharmaceutical company received\\nconsideration from the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion (FDA) to apply for approval of a new enzyme re-\\nplacement therapy that would provide long-term treat-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 693\\nEnzyme therapy\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 693'),\n",

The supplements are typically given in tablet or\\ncapsule form. Pancreatic enzymes may also be given by\\ninjection. The dosage varies with the condition being\\ntreated.

However, it is always advisable to\\ntalk to a doctor or pharmacist before purchasing en-\\nzymes and beginning therapy .\\nPrecautions\\nPeople with allergies to beef, pork, pineapples, and\\npapaya may suffer allergic reactions to enzyme supple-\\nments. T ablets are often coated to prevent them from\\nbreaking down in the stomach, and usually shouldn’t be\\nchewed or crushed. People who have difficulty swallow-\\ning pills can request enzyme supplements in capsule\\nform. The capsules can then be opened and the contents\\nsprinkled onto soft foods like applesauce.\\nSide effects\\nSide effects associated with enzyme therapy include\\nheartburn, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bloating, gas,\\nand acne. According to the principles of therapy , these are\\ntemporary cleansing symptoms. Drinking eight to ten glass-\\nes of water daily and getting regular exercisecan reduce the\\ndiscomfort of these side effects. Individuals may also expe-\\nrience an increase in bowel movements, perhaps one or two\\nper day . This is also considered a positive effect.\\nPlant enzymes are safe for pregnant women, al-\\nthough they should always check with a doctor before\\nusing enzymes. Pregnant women should avoid animal\\nenzymes. In rare cases, extremely high doses of enzymes\\ncan result in a build up of uric acid in the blood or urine\\nand can cause a break down of proteins.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nIn the United States, the FDA has classified enzymes\\nas a food.

Reproduced by permission.)\\nEphedra\\nDescription\\nEphedra, also known as Ma Huang, is an herb uti-\\nlized by Chinese medicine for more than 2,500 years due\\nto its ability to remedy symptoms of asthma and upper\\nrespiratory infections . A member of the Ephedracae\\nfamily of herbs ( Ephedra sinica ), ephedra is native to\\nnorthern China and Inner Mongolia where it thrives in\\ndesert areas as a jointed, barkless plant with branches\\nthat bear few leaves and tiny yellow-green flowers that\\nbloom in summer. While varieties of ephedra grow\\nthroughout the world, the United States version flourish-\\nes in the dry southwest.\\nEphedra became popular to Mormon settlers in\\nthe early 1800s as a stimulant consumed in the form\\nof tea in place of the coffee and black tea from which\\nthey abstained, giving the plant one of its many\\nnames, Mormon T ea. Other folk names that have re-\\nsulted over time include Desert T ea, Desert Herb, and\\nSquaw T ea. The herbal drink was named Whorehouse\\nT ea after it was served in brothels during the 1800s\\ndue to unproven beliefs that it cured gonorrhea and\\nsyphilis .\\nThe medicinal herb Ma Huang is made of the\\ndried, young branchlets of ephedra. Harvested in the\\nautumn, ephedra is reproduced from seed or by root di-\\nvision and the stems are dried in the sun throughout the\\nyear for production. The herb should be stored away\\nfrom light. Ephedra gains its strength primarily from\\nthe alkaloid ephedrine, pseudephedrine, and norpseude-\\nphedrine. These active ingredients produce central ner-\\nvous system stimulation. Other key components of\\nephedra include:\\n• tannin, an acidic substance found in the bark\\n• saponin, originating in the roots\\n• flavone, the chemical from which natural colors of\\nmany plants originate\\n• volatile oil\\nGeneral use\\nA bitter-tasting herb that has been relied upon by\\nthe Chinese throughout centuries to heal ailments from\\nfevers and chills , to nasal and chest congestion,\\nephedra also maintains its prominence as a strong stim-\\nulant. Contrary to its reputation, Zen monks used the\\nherb to promote calm concentration during meditation .\\nHowever, larger amounts can make a person jittery .\\nT oday , ephedra is used in the United States as an herbal\\nmedicine to treat asthma and hay fever , and the begin-\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 695'),\n",

The herb is also used to raise\\nblood pressure, cool fevers, and ease the pain of\\nrheumatism.\\nWhile ephedrine was used in various decongestant\\nand bronchodilator products in the United States begin-\\nning in the late 1920s through the 1940s, its potential for\\ncausing dangerous side effects led to the creation of a\\nchemical substitute. Scientists created the equally effec-\\ntive, but safer, pseudephedrine that remains the active in-\\ngredient in many over-the-counter (OTC) products such\\nas Sudafed. Primatene Mist, an OTC that contains\\nephedrine, is used regularly to treat asthma.\\nThe body responds to ephedra as one of its key in-\\ngredients, ephedrine, opens bronchial passages, activat-\\ning the heart and raising blood pressure while increasing\\nmetabolism. Due to its stimulating effect on the nervous\\nsystem, many weight loss and energy products contain\\nephedra. Ephedrine increases basal metabolic rate\\n(BMR), causing the body to burn calories faster. Dieters\\nuse ephedra-based products because they suppress the\\nappetite and stimulate metabolism. While these diet\\nproducts prove to be effective, their results are rarely\\npermanent, and long-term use can be quite harmful.\\nChinese sources only recommended its use for acute sit-\\nuations.\\nAs an “energy” product, ephedra increases alertness\\nand perception. The use of ephedra in this way dates\\nback to bodyguards of Genghis Khan, who, legend has\\nit, fearful of being beheaded if they fell asleep on duty ,\\nconsumed tea containing ephedra to stay alert. Caffeine\\nproducts, such as coffee, tea, chocolate, and cola drinks,\\nenhance the effect of energy products containing\\nephedra. Additional medicinal uses of ephedra include\\nthe promotion of menstruation , the decreased desire\\nfor cigarettes, and the promotion of uterine contractions.\\nMa Huang is also known for its ability to increase sexu-\\nal sensation.\\nSome controversy surrounds the extended use of\\nephedra. It is recommended that products containing\\nephedra be taken only for short periods of time. T achy-\\nphylaxis, or becoming immune to a drug’s effectiveness\\ndue to overuse, and dependence on the drug may develop\\nwhen taken consistently over time. Both ephedrine and\\nMa Huang are considered doping substances. In April\\n1996, the United States Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) issued a warning on dietary supplements contain-\\ning ephedra that were labeling themselves as safe substi-\\ntutes for “street drugs, ” such as the illegal drug ecstasy .\\nThe FDA stated that these products could have “poten-\\ntially dangerous effects on the nervous system and heart. ”\\nEphedra is classified as a dietary supplement, and\\nunlike pharmaceutical companies that must follow\\nstrict rules regarding safety , efficacy , and quality set by\\nthe FDA, manufacturers of supplements are not held to\\nthese guidelines. In 1994, the regulation of herbal med-\\nicine-type products in the United States changed with\\nthe passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Edu-\\ncation Act (DSHEA). At this time, herbal products\\nwere reclassified, along with vitamins and minerals, as\\ndietary supplements. When classified in this grouping\\nthat falls somewhere between food and over-the-\\ncounter drugs, herbal supplement manufacturers were\\nthen able to begin making “structure-function” claims\\nfor a product on its label if there is scientific evidence\\nsupporting these claims. When appropriate, supplement\\nmanufacturers are allowed to use three types of claims:\\nnutrient-content claims, disease claims, and nutrition\\nsupport claims. These claims are made to guide the\\nbuyers of supplements, but supplement manufacturers\\nmay use the claims without FDA authorization, and are\\nnot required by law to conduct scientific studies on\\ntheir products. In March 1999, the placement of a\\n“Supplement Facts” panel became a requirement on the\\nlabels of most dietary supplements. In January 2002,\\nThe United States Pharmacopeial Convention an-\\nnounced it would launch a dietary supplement verifica-\\ntion program. Though voluntary , the program would\\nallow supplement manufacturers to provide documenta-\\ntion that they had a quality standard system in place,\\nthe organization would audit that system, then verify\\nthe quality of the supplement as long as the manufac-\\nturer continued to meet the criteria.\\nWhile questions surround the correct use of\\nephedra in the United States, the German government’s\\nFederal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Com-\\nmission E) certifies that ephedra herba, ephedra, and Ma\\nHuang is an approved remedy for diseases of the respi-\\nratory tract with mild bronchospasms. Approval from\\nCommission E, however, is not equivalent to the FDA ’s\\nhigher standards of drug approval. Some states in the\\nUnited States have limited the use of ephedra, or banned\\nthe drug completely .\\nPreparations\\nEphedra is available over the counter as a fluid ex-\\ntract, in tablet form, or as a dried bulk herb at Chinese\\npharmacies, Asian markets, and health food stores where\\nit is permitted throughout the United States. When pur-\\nchasing the herb, be certain to avoid those that look dry\\nor have a greenish-brown cross section.\\nChinese herbalists prepare ephedra for use by com-\\nbining one part honey , four parts dried herb in combina-\\ntion with other herbs, and a small amount of water in a\\nwok.

Coughing and wheezing are remedied with a mix-\\nture of ephedra and apricot seed, while licorice is added\\nto the herb for stomachaches . An upper respiratory in-\\nfection, or congestion, is treated with a combination of\\nephedra and ginger . The powder form, mixed with\\nrehmannia, is also used by the Chinese to treat kidney en-\\nergy (yin) deficiency . It is recommended to consult a Chi-\\nnese medicine practitioner, or physician for detailed in-\\nformation on mixtures of ephedra and doses of the herb.\\nAs the United States has adopted the herb for its\\nhealing properties, the variety of ephedra preparations\\nhas increased. The average single dose of ephedrine for\\nadults is 15–30 mg, with a maximum allowed daily dose\\nof 300 mg per day . When consumed as a tea, 1 teaspoon\\n(5 ml) of ephedra is boiled with 1 cup (250 ml) water for\\n15–20 minutes, with up to 2 cups (500 ml) of the tea al-\\nlowed per day . This tea (also known as a decoction) is\\nprescribed by herbalists for asthma. The tincture prepa-\\nration is used in treatments to ease the aches and joint\\npains caused by rheumatism. The amount of tincture rec-\\nommended is 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 ml)–1 teaspoon (5 ml)\\nin combination with other herbs, up to three times a day .\\nAs a dietary supplement, there is no FDA control\\nover the manufacturing of ephedra, including what is in\\nthe pill, additional ingredients added to the pill, how it is\\nproduced, or what part of the plant it is made from. For\\nexample, when the whole ephedra plant is used for treat-\\nment, the side effects are minimal. When key ingredi-\\nents, such as ephedrine, are isolated from the herb, the\\nstrength of the drug increases, therefore increasing the\\nside effects. The potencies and purity within supple-\\nments vary greatly by brand and by bottle, resulting in\\nthe difficulty of exact dosage recommendations. It is rec-\\nommended that directions on the product’s label are fol-\\nlowed exactly for proper use.\\nPrecautions\\nWhile ephedra may be taken safely in the correct\\ndoses, the supplement has shown to be harmful to chil-\\ndren, adolescents, older or chronically ill people, and\\npregnant women or women who are breastfeeding.\\nThose with heart disease, high blood pressure, prostate\\nenlargement , pheochromocytoma, diabetes, glaucoma ,\\nthyrotoxicosis, overactive thyroid gland ( hyperthy-\\nroidism), nervousness, anorexia, insomnia, suicidal ten-\\ndencies, stomach ulcers, or bulimia should not take\\nephedra. It is also recommended that the herb be avoided\\nby those with diarrhea or abdominal bloating.\\nIt should be noted that ephedra is an ingredient in\\nmany weight-loss aids. While it is effective for a dieter’s\\npurpose as it accelerates his/her metabolism, the excess\\nstimulation can cause dangerous consequences. The\\nstrength of the herb is extremely powerful as a stimulant,\\nwith its active ingredient epinephrine mimicking the ef-\\nfects of adrenaline. The molecular structure of epineph-\\nrine is close to methampetamine, also known as speed,\\nand the use of ephedra can result in a positive test for\\namphetamines in the urine. Regular use of ephedra has\\nshown to lead to dependence on the herb.\\nMany cases of Ma Huang toxicity have been report-\\ned to the FDA and possibly serious cardiovascular ef-\\nfects have been associated with its use. Health Canada\\nissued a recall for products containing more than recom-\\nmended levels of ephedra in early 2002 because of seri-\\nous, possibly fatal, side effects. The dose limits set by\\nCanadian authorities were more than 8 mg of ephedrine\\nor a label that recommended more than 8 mg per dose or\\n32 mg per day . It also included products recommended\\nuse exceeding seven days.\\nA 2002 study concluded that use of Ma Huang could\\nbe associated with serious complications including in-\\ncreased risk of stroke, heart attack or even sudden death\\nand that the effects were not limited to massive doses.\\nSide effects\\nSide effects of ephedra include insomnia,dry mouth,\\nnervousness, irritability , headache , and dizziness . The\\nfollowing side effects are considered serious: increased\\nblood pressure, increased heart rate, and heart palpita-\\ntions. If these develop, the use of ephedra should be\\nstopped and a physician should be consulted immediately .\\nIn 2000, the FDA reported that the herb ephedra\\nwhen used as a weight-loss product could result in serious\\nside effects, including heart attack, stroke, and high blood\\npressure. These potentially life-threatening outcomes, es-\\npecially to those people with heart problems, are a result\\nof those products that combine ephedra with other stimu-\\nlants, such as caffeine. At this time it is estimated that four\\nmillion people safely use products that contain the com-\\nbined ingredients of ephedra and caffeine.\\nEphedra may be life threatening if taken in very\\nhigh dosages (over 100 g, lethal dosage when taken oral-\\nly corresponding to approximately 1–2 g L-ephedrine).\\nSigns of poisoning by the herb include severe outbreaks\\nof sweating, enlarged pupils, spasms and elevated body\\ntemperature, with heart failure and asphyxiation causing\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 697\\nEphedra\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 697'),\n",

Odle\\nEpididymitis\\nDefinition\\nEpididymitis is the inflammation or infection of the\\nepididymis, the long coiled tube that attaches to the\\nupper part of each testicle. The epididymis functions as a\\nstorage, transport, and maturation place for sperm before\\nejaculation.\\nDescription\\nIn adults, epididymitis is the most common cause of\\npain in the scrotum, and in adolescents, the second most\\ncommon cause. The acute form is usually associated\\nwith the most severe pain and swelling. If symptoms last\\nfor more than six weeks after treatment begins, the con-\\ndition is considered chronic.\\nEpididymitis is most common between the ages of\\n18 and 40, but children can get it, too. Boys who experi-\\nence painful urination, have a history of urinary tract in-\\nfections, abnormal bladder function, or abnormalities of\\nthe genitals and urinary structures are more inclined to\\nget epididymitis. It is seldom found in adolescents who\\naren’t sexually active.\\nThe infection is especially common among mem-\\nbers of the military who exercise for extended periods\\nwithout emptying their bladders.\\nFactors that increase the risk of developing epi-\\ndidymitis include:\\n• infection of the bladder, kidney , prostate, or urinary\\ntract\\n• other recent illness\\n• narrowing of the urethra (the tube that drains urine\\nfrom the bladder)\\n• use of a urethral catheter\\nThe infection doesn’t start in the epididymis. It is an\\nascending infection that most often starts in the urethra\\nor urinary tract before spreading to the epididymis.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAmong men under age 35 who are sexually active,\\nChlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae are the\\nmost common causes of epididymitis.\\nNonsexually transmitted epididymitis is associated\\nwith urinary tract infections and is more common in men\\nwho have undergone surgery for urinary tract problems\\nor who have anatomical abnormalities.\\nAlthough epididymitis is often caused by and asso-\\nciated with some of the same organisms that cause some\\nsexually transmitted diseases, there are other causes as\\nwell. The condition can also be attributed to pus-generat-\\ning bacteria associated with infections in other parts of\\nthe body . This cause, however, is rare.\\nEpididymitis can also be caused by injury or infec-\\ntion of the scrotum or by irritation from urine that has\\naccumulated in the vas deferens (the duct through which\\nsperm travels after leaving the epididymis).\\nEpididymitis is characterized by pain in the testes.\\nThe pain, which usually develops gradually over several\\nhours or days, is followed by sudden redness and\\nswelling of the scrotum. Generally , only one testicle is\\naffected. The affected testicle is hard and sore, and the\\nother testicle may feel tender. The patient has chills ,a\\nlow-grade fever ,and usually has acute urethritis (inflam-\\nmation of the urethra).\\nSometimes, there is a discharge from the urethra and\\nblood in the semen. Ejaculation can be painful.\\nEnlarged lymph nodes in the groin cause scrotal\\npain that intensifies throughout the day and may become\\nso severe that walking normally becomes impossible.\\nDiagnosis\\nDoctors test for epididymitis through:\\n• Urinalysis, which will likely show an elevated white\\nblood-cell count and the presence of bacteria.\\n• Urine culture, to identify the organism responsible for\\nthe infection.\\n• Examination of discharges from the urethra and\\nprostate gland.\\n• Blood tests to measure white-cell counts, which will be\\nelevated.\\n• Ultrasound, which will reveal an enlarged epididymis.\\nThe condition may lead to an abscess or cause such\\ncomplications as infertility , so it is best to consult a\\nurologist about the condition and treatment.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 699\\nEpididymitis\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 699'),\n",

With alternative therapies, the treatment involves\\nincreasing circulation to the area. This reduces inflam-\\nmation, which helps the body heal.\\nFasting is recommended for some people, since di-\\ngestion slows down the body’s healing mechanisms. A\\nwater fast is best, but if that isn’t possible, the patient\\nshould confine intake to fruit and vegetable juices. If\\nfood must be eaten, a light diet of fresh fruits and vegeta-\\nbles is recommended. Fasting eases pain.

Herbs like philodendron (Huang Bai) are used for\\ninflammation in the lower torso area. Pulsatilla , which\\nhelps with swelling and pain, particularly in the genitals,\\nand podophyllum are the most effective in treating epi-\\ndidymitis.

The\\nwater should be as hot as can be tolerated.\\nHomeopathy is also an option. Homeopathic physi-\\ncians may prescribe remedies that are specific to the person.\\nSince epididymitis is caused by an infection and often\\ninvolves the urinary tract, the following alternative reme-\\ndies may also be helpful in treatment of the condition:\\n• Acupuncture, which may help ward off another infec-\\ntion.\\n• Aromatherapy . A hot sitz bath with drops of juniper\\nberry or sandalwood may relieve symptoms of the in-\\nfection.\\n• Chiropractic. Strengthening bladder muscles by adjust-\\ning the joints and bones in the pelvic area may keep in-\\nfection at bay .\\nAllopathic treatment\\nEpididymitis is traditionally treated with antibiotic\\ntherapy . T o prevent reinfection, patients must take their\\nmedication exactly as prescribed, even if the patient’s\\nsymptoms disappear or if he begins to feel better. Over-\\nthe-counter anti-inflammatories may be taken to relieve\\npain. The over-the-counter medicines will have the same\\neffects as herbal anti-inflammatories.\\nBed rest is recommended until symptoms subside,\\nand patients are advised to wear athletic supporters when\\nthey resume normal activities. If pain is severe, a local\\nanesthetic like lidocaine (Xylocaine) may be injected di-\\nrectly into the spermatic cord. Scrotal ice packs and\\nscrotal elevation are also recommended.\\nSelf-care\\nA patient who has epididymitis should not drink\\nbeverages that contain caffeine . T o prevent\\nconstipation, he should use stool softeners or eat plenty\\nof fruit, nuts, whole grain cereals, and other foods with\\nlaxative properties.\\nStrenuous activity should be avoided until symp-\\ntoms disappear. Sexual activity should not be resumed\\nuntil a month after symptoms disappear.\\nIf a second course of treatment doesn’t eradicate\\nstubborn symptoms, long-term anti-inflammatory thera-\\npy may be recommended.

A seizure is a sudden disruption of\\nthe brain’s normal electrical activity accompanied by al-\\ntered consciousness and/or other neurological and be-\\nhavioral manifestations.\\nDescription\\nEpilepsy affects 1–2% of the population of the Unit-\\ned States. Although epilepsy is as common in adults over\\n60 as in children under 10, 25% of all cases develop be-\\nfore the age of five. One in every two cases develops be-\\nfore the age of 25. About 125,000 new cases of epilepsy\\nare diagnosed each year, and a significant number of\\nchildren and adults that have not been diagnosed or treat-\\ned have epilepsy .\\nMost seizures are benign, but a seizure that lasts a\\nlong time can lead to status epilepticus, a life-threatening\\ncondition characterized by continuous seizures, sus-\\ntained loss of consciousness, and respiratory distress.\\nNonconvulsive epilepsy can impair physical coordina-\\ntion, vision, and other senses. Undiagnosed seizures can\\nlead to conditions that are more serious and more diffi-\\ncult to manage.\\nT ypes of seizures\\nGeneralized epileptic seizures occur when electrical\\nabnormalities exist throughout the brain. A partial\\nseizure does not involve the entire brain. A partial\\nseizure begins in an area called an epileptic focus, but\\nmay spread to other parts of the brain and cause a gener-\\nalized seizure. Some people who have epilepsy have\\nmore than one type of seizure.\\nMotor attacks cause parts of the body to jerk repeated-\\nly . A motor attack usually lasts less than an hour and may\\nlast only a few minutes. Sensory seizures begin with\\nnumbness or tingling in one area. The sensation may move\\nalong one side of the body or the back before subsiding.\\nV isual seizures that affect the area of the brain that\\ncontrols sight cause people to hallucinate. Auditory\\nseizures affect the part of the brain that controls hearing\\nand cause the patient to imagine hearing voices, music,\\nand other sounds. Other types of seizures can cause con-\\nfusion, upset stomach, or emotional distress.\\nPARTIAL SEIZURES. Simple partial seizures do not\\nspread from the focal area where they arise. Symptoms\\nare determined by the part of the brain affected. The pa-\\ntient usually remains conscious during the seizure and\\ncan later describe it in detail.\\nCOMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURES. A distinctive smell,\\ntaste, or other unusual sensation (aura) may signal the\\nstart of a complex partial seizure.\\nfluids, which will increase urine flow , will help prevent\\nurine retention, which can lead to infection.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nThe Alternative Advisor .

Neuroimaging provides views of\\nbrain areas involved in seizure activity .\\nThe electroencephalogram (EEG) is the main test\\nused to diagnose epilepsy . EEGs use electrodes placed\\non or within the skull to record the brain’s electrical ac-\\ntivity and pinpoint the exact location of abnormal dis-\\ncharges.\\nThe patient may be asked to remain motionless dur-\\ning a short-term EEG or to go about his normal activities\\nduring extended monitoring. Some patients are deprived\\nof sleep or exposed to seizure triggers, such as rapid,\\ndeep breathing (hyperventilation) or flashing lights\\n(photic stimulation).

Relaxation techniques can provide\\nsome sense of control over the disorder, but they should\\nnever be used instead of antiseizure medication or with-\\nout the approval of the patient’s doctor. Y oga, medita-\\ntion , and favorite pastimes help some people relax and\\nmanage stress more successfully . Biofeedback can teach\\nadults and older adolescents how to recognize an aura\\nand what to do to stop its spread. Children under 14 usu-\\nally are not able to understand and apply principles of\\nbiofeedback.\\nAcupuncture\\nAcupuncture treatments (acupuncture needles in-\\nserted for a few minutes or left in place for as long as 30\\nminutes) make some people feel pleasantly relaxed.\\nAcupressure\\nAcupressure can have the same effect on children\\nor on adults who dislike needles.\\nAromatherapy\\nAromatherapy involves mixing aromatic plant oils\\ninto water or other oils and massaging them into the skin\\nor using a special burner to waft their fragrance through-\\nout the room. Aromatherapy oils affect the body and the\\nbrain, and undiluted oils should never be applied directly\\nto the skin. Ylang ylang, chamomile , or lavender can\\ncreate a soothing mood. People who have epilepsy\\nshould not use rosemary , hyssop , citrus (such as\\nlemon), sage, or sweet fennel , which seem to stimulate\\nthe brain.\\nNutritional therapy\\nKETOGENIC DIET .A special high-fat, low-protein, low-\\ncarbohydrate diet is sometimes used to treat patients whose\\nsevere seizures have not responded to other treatment. Cal-\\nculated according to age, height, and weight, the ketogenic\\ndiet induces mild starvation and dehydration. This forces\\nthe body to create an excessive supply of ketones, natural\\nchemicals with seizure-suppressing properties.\\nThe goal of this controversial approach is to main-\\ntain or improve seizure control while reducing medica-\\ntion. The ketogenic diet works best with children be-\\ntween the ages of one and 10. It is introduced over a pe-\\nriod of several days, and most children are hospitalized\\nduring the early stages of treatment.\\nIf a child following this diet remains seizure-free for\\nat least six months, increased amounts of carbohydrates\\nand protein are gradually added. If the child shows no\\nimprovement after three months, the diet is gradually\\ndiscontinued.

Long-term anticonvulsant drug therapy is the most\\ncommon form of epilepsy treatment.\\nMedication\\nA combination of drugs may be needed to control\\nsome symptoms, but most patients who have epilepsy\\ntake one of the following medications:\\n• Dilantin (phenytoin)\\n• T egretol (carbamazepine)\\n• Barbita (phenobarbital)\\n• Mysoline (primidone)\\n• Depakene (valproic acid, sodium valproate)\\n• Klonopin (clonazepam)\\n• Zarontin (ethosuximide)\\nDilantin, T egretol, Barbita, and Mysoline are used to\\nmanage or control generalized tonic-clonic and complex\\npartial seizures.

This is important, because elderly patients\\noften have other conditions and must take other medica-\\ntions that might interact with seizure medications. In\\n2003, Keppra’s manufacturer was working on a new\\nantiepilectic drug from the same chemical family as\\nKeppra that should be more potent and effective. A vail-\\nable medications frequently change, and the physician\\nwill determine the best treatment for an individual pa-\\ntient.

A psy-\\nchiatrist, chaplain, or other spiritual advisor may help the\\npatient and his family cope with the stresses that occur\\nduring and after the selection process.\\nTYPES OF SURGERY . Surgical techniques used to\\ntreat intractable epilepsy include:\\n• Lesionectomy . Removing the lesion (diseased brain tis-\\nsue) and some surrounding brain tissue is very effective\\nin controlling seizures. Lesionectomy is generally more\\nsuccessful than surgery performed on patients whose\\nseizures are not caused by clearly defined lesions, but\\nremoving only part of the lesion lessens the effective-\\nness of the procedure.\\n• T emporal resections. Removing part of the temporal\\nlobe and the part of the brain associated with feelings,\\nmemory , and emotions (the hippocampus) provides\\ngood or excellent seizure control in 75–80% of proper-\\nly selected patients with appropriate types of temporal\\nlobe epilepsy . Some patients experience post-operative\\nspeech and memory problems.\\n• Extra-temporal resection. This procedure involves re-\\nmoving some or all of the frontal lobe, the part of the\\nbrain directly behind the forehead. The frontal lobe\\nhelps regulate movement, planning, judgment, and per-\\nsonality . Special care must be taken to prevent post-op-\\nerative problems with movement and speech. Extra-\\ntemporal resection is most successful in patients whose\\nseizures are not widespread.\\n• Hemispherectomy . This method of removing brain tis-\\nsue is restricted to patients with severe epilepsy and ab-\\nnormal discharges that often extend from one side of\\nthe brain to the other. Hemispherectomies are most\\noften performed on infants or young children who have\\nhad an extensive brain disease or disorder since birth or\\nfrom a very young age.\\n• Corpus callosotomy . This procedure, an alternative to\\nhemispherectomy in patients with congenital hemiple-\\ngia, removes some or all of the white matter that sepa-\\nrates the two halves of the brain. Corpus callosotomy is\\nperformed almost exclusively on children who are fre-\\nquently injured during falls caused by seizures. If re-\\nmoving two–thirds of the corpus callosum does not\\nproduce lasting improvement in the patient’s condition,\\nthe remaining one-third will be removed during another\\noperation.\\n• Multiple subpial transection. This procedure is used to\\ncontrol the spread of seizures that originate in or affect\\nthe “eloquent” cortex, the area of the brain responsible\\nfor complex thought and reasoning.\\nOther forms of treatment\\nVAGUS NERVE STIMULATION. Approved for adults\\nand adolescents (over 16 years old) with intractable\\nseizures, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) uses a pace-\\nmaker-like device implanted under the skin in the upper\\nleft chest, to provide intermittent stimulation to the\\nvagus nerve. Stretching from the side of the neck into the\\nbrain, the vagus nerve affects swallowing, speech,\\nbreathing, and many other functions, and VNS may pre-\\nvent or shorten some seizures.\\nFirst aid for seizures\\nA person with epilepsy having a seizure should not\\nbe restrained, but sharp or dangerous objects should be\\nmoved out of reach. Anyone having a complex partial\\nseizure can be warned away from danger by someone\\ncalling his/her name in a clear, calm voice.\\nA person with epilepsy having a grand mal seizure\\nshould be helped to lie down, and those aiding the pa-\\ntient should contact emergency medical personnel. Tight\\nclothing should be loosened. A soft, flat object like a\\ntowel or the palm of a hand should be placed under the\\nperson’s head. Forcing a hard object into the mouth of\\nsomeone having a grand mal seizure could cause injuries\\nor breathing problems. If the person’s mouth is open,\\nplacing a folded cloth or other soft object between his or\\nher teeth will protect the tongue. Turning the patient’s\\nhead to the side will help with breathing. After a grand\\nmal seizure has ended, the person who had the seizure\\nshould be told what has happened and reminded of\\nwhere he or she is.\\nExpected results\\nPeople who have epilepsy have a higher than aver-\\nage rate of suicide; sudden, unexplained death; and\\ndrowning and other accidental fatalities.\\nBenign focal epilepsy of childhood and some ab-\\nsence seizures may disappear in time, but remission is un-\\nlikely if seizures occur several times a day , several times\\nin a 48-hour period, or more frequently than in the past.\\nEpilepsy can be partially or completely controlled if\\nthe individual takes antiseizure medication according to\\ndirections; avoids seizure-inducing sights, sounds, and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 705\\nEpilepsy\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 705'),\n",

Shen Nong’s Canon of Medici-\\nnal Herbs, compiled around 400 A.D., mentions its use.\\nThe odorless, bitter herb has been used as a:\\n• Kidney tonic to help relieve problems of frequent urina-\\ntion and correct problems of lightheadedness and weak-\\nness associated with improper body fluid volumes.\\n• Reproductive system tonic to treat impotence and pre-\\nmature ejaculation.\\n• Rejuvenating tonic, as an aphrodisiac or to relieve fa-\\ntigue.\\nThe herb, which dilates blood vessels, has also been\\nused to treat coronary heart disease, asthma, bronchitis,\\nand sinusitis. An expectorant, it can be used to control\\ncoughing. It can also be used to lower blood pressure.\\nStudies have shown that epimedium raises adrena-\\nline, noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine levels in\\nanimals. It is the dopamine that may be responsible for\\nthe herb’s use as a reproductive tonic. The increased\\ndopamine levels in the body set off a chain reaction that\\nleads to a release of testosterone, the male sex hormone.\\nOther evidence suggests the herb increases sensitivi-\\nty in nerve endings, which may explain why it is pre-\\nscribed as an aphrodisiac.\\nPreparations\\nThe herb is collected in summer or early autumn,\\nthen dried in the sun.

They are present in every healthy cell in the\\nbody , and are critical for the normal growth and func-\\ntioning of the cells, muscles, nerves, and organs. EF As\\nare also used by the body to produce a class of hormone-\\nlike substances called prostaglandins, which are key to\\nmany important processes. Deficiencies of EF As are\\nlinked to a variety of health problems, including major\\nones such as heart disease , cancer, and diabetes. It has\\nbeen estimated that as many as 80% of American people\\nmay consume insufficient quantities of EF As.\\nV ery few health issues have received as much atten-\\ntion during the past several decades as the question of fat\\nin the diet. Sixty-eight percent of deaths in America are\\nrelated to fat consumption and diet, including heart dis-\\nease (44% of deaths), cancer (22%) and diabetes (2%).\\nThere are several types of dietary fats. Saturated fat is\\nfound mainly in animal products, including meat and\\ndairy products, and avocados, and nuts. Cholesterol is a\\ndietary fat that is only found in animal products. Choles-\\nterol is also made by the body in small amounts from\\nsaturated fats. Heavy consumption of saturated fat and\\ncholesterol has been linked to heart disease and cancer .\\nUnsaturated fats are typically oils from vegetables, nuts,\\nand are present in some fish. These are considered the\\nhealthiest dietary fats. Essential fatty acids are unsaturat-\\ned fats. EF As are the only fats that may need to be in-\\ncreased in the American diet.\\nScientists classify essential fatty acids into two\\ntypes, omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids, de-\\npending on their chemical composition. T echnically , the\\nomega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid, stearidonic\\nacid, and two others called EP A and DHA. Alpha-\\nlinolenic acid is found mainly in flaxseed oil, canola oil,\\nsoybeans, walnuts, hemp seeds, and dark green leafy\\nvegetables. Stearidonic acid is found in rarer types of\\nseeds and nuts, including black currant seeds. EP A and\\nDHA are present in cold-water fish, including salmon,\\ntrout, sardines, mackerel, and cod. Cod liver oil is a pop-\\nular nutritional supplement for omega-3 EF As.\\nOmega-6 fatty acids are more common in the Amer-\\nican diet than the omega-3 EF As. These include linoleic\\nacid , which is found in safflower, olive, almond, sun-\\nflower, hemp, soybean, walnut, pumpkin, sesame, and\\nflaxseed oils. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is found in\\nsome seeds and evening primrose oil . Arachidonic acid\\n(AA) is present in meat and animal products.\\nBoth types of EF As, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty\\nacids, are necessary in a healthy diet. Deficiencies of\\nEF As have been brought about by changes in diet and\\nthe modern processing of foods and oils. Many nutrition-\\nists believe that a major dietary problem is the use of hy-\\ndrogenated oils, which are present in margarine and\\nmany processed foods. Hydrogenated oils are highly re-\\nfined by industrial processes, and contain toxic by-prod-\\nucts and trans-fatty acids. Trans-fatty acids are fat mole-\\ncules with chemically altered structures, and are believed\\nto have several detrimental effects on the body . Trans-\\nfatty acids interfere with the absorption of healthy EF As,\\nand may contribute to atherosclerosis, or damage to the\\narteries. Deep-fried foods, which are cooked in oil that is\\naltered by very high temperatures, also contain trans-\\nfatty acids. Many health professionals, including those at\\nthe W orld Heath Organization, have protested against the\\nuse of hydrogenated oils in food and the consumption of\\ntrans-fatty acids. Health conditions linked to the con-\\nsumption of trans-fatty acids and hydrogenated oils in-\\nclude cancer, heart disease, high cholesterol, diabetes,\\nobesity , immune system disorders, decreased sperm\\ncounts, and infant development problems.\\nDietary changes that have contributed to EF A defi-\\nciency or imbalances include the increased use of oils\\nthat contain few or no omega-3 EF As; the industrial\\nmilling of flour that removes the EF A-containing germ;\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2708\\nEssential fatty acids\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 708'),\n",

Americans typically con-\\nsume higher quantities of omega-6 EF As, because these\\nare found in meat, animal products, and common cook-\\ning oils. Research has shown that too many omega-6\\nEF As in the diet can lead to the imbalanced production\\nof prostaglandins, which may contribute to health prob-\\nlems. Experts recommend that omega-3 and omega-6\\nEF As be present in the diet in a ratio of around one to\\nthree. Americans consume a ratio as high as one to 40.\\nThus, the need for greater amounts of omega-3 EF As in\\nthe diet has increased.\\nSymptoms of EF A deficiency or imbalance include\\ndry or scaly skin, excessively dry hair, cracked finger-\\nnails, fatigue , weakness, frequent infections , allergies ,\\nmood disorders, hyperactivity , depression, memory and\\nlearning problems, slow wound healing, aching joints,\\npoor digestion, high blood pressure, obesity , and high\\ncholesterol.\\nGeneral use\\nEF A supplementation is recommended for more than\\n60 health conditions. EF As are used therapeutically to\\ntreat and prevent cardiovascular problems, including\\nheart disease, high cholesterol, strokes, and high blood\\npressure. EF As also have anti-inflammatory effects in the\\nbody , and are used in the nutritional treatment of arthritis,\\nasthma , allergies, and skin conditions (e.g., eczema ).\\nEF As are used as support for immune system disorders\\nincluding AIDS, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and cancer.\\nOther conditions that may improve with EF A sup-\\nplementation include acne and other skin problems, dia-\\nbetes, depression, menopausal problems, nervous condi-\\ntions, obesity , memory and learning disabilities, eye\\nproblems, and digestive disorders. EF As are recom-\\nmended for weight loss programs, as they may assist fat\\nmetabolism in the body . EF A supplementation is a rec-\\nommended preventative practice, as well.\\nPreparations\\nCommon EF A supplements are flaxseed oil,evening\\nprimrose oil , borage oil , black currant seed oil , hemp\\nseed oil, and cod liver oil. Consumers should search for\\nsupplements that contain both omega-3 and omega-6\\nEF As, because imbalances of EF As may occur if either is\\ntaken in excess over long periods of time. Flaxseed oil is\\na recommended supplement, because it contains the high-\\nest percentage of omega-3 fatty acids with some omega-6\\nEF As, as well. Flaxseed oil is generally the least expen-\\nsive source of omega-3 EF As as well, generally much\\ncheaper than fish oil supplements. Evening primrose oil\\nis a popular supplement as well, because the GLA it con-\\ntains has shown benefits in treating premenstrual syn-\\ndrome and other conditions. However, evening primrose\\noil contains no omega-3 EF As. Hemp seed oil is a well-\\nbalanced source of both EF As.\\nSupplements are available from health food stores in\\nliquid and capsule form. The recommended daily dosage\\nis one to two tablespoons (13-26 capsules), taken with\\nmeals. EF As can also be obtained from a diet that in-\\ncludes cold-water fish consumed twice per week, whole\\ngrains, dark green leafy vegetables, walnuts, pumpkin\\nseeds, wheat germ , soy products, canola oil, and other\\nfoods mentioned above. Whole flaxseeds are a whole-\\nsome source of EF As as well, and can be freshly ground\\nand added to salads and other dishes. Supplements that\\ncontain the enzyme lipase help the body more efficiently\\ndigest the oils.\\nPrecautions\\nEF A supplements are generally fragile products, and\\nmust be produced, packaged and handled properly . Con-\\nsumers should search for quality EF A supplements pro-\\nduced by reputable manufacturers. Products that are or-\\nganically grown and certified by a third party are recom-\\nmended. EF A products should be produced by “cold or\\nmodified expeller pressing, ” which means that they were\\nproduced without damaging temperatures or pressure.\\nProducts should be packaged in light-resistant containers,\\nbecause sunlight damages EF As. Packages should in-\\nclude manufacturing and expiration dates, in order to as-\\nsure freshness. Stores and consumers should keep EF A\\nproducts under refrigeration, because heat damages them.\\nT aste can indicate the quality of EF A oils: those that have\\nno flavor usually are overly refined, and those that taste\\nbitter are old or spoiled. Because of their low temperature\\nthreshold, nearly all oils that are used as EF A supple-\\nments are not suitable for use as cooking oils.\\nIn 2001, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) began cautioning pregnant and nursing women\\nand parents of infants and toddlers about the potential\\ndangers of exposure to mercury from fish rich in omega-\\n3 fatty acids, and from fish oil capsules. High levels of\\nmercury can affect brain development in fetuses and\\nyoung children. The FDA recommends that these groups\\ninstead opt for younger species of fish such as canned\\ntuna or farm-raised fish and skip fish oil capsules alto-\\ngether.

Aromatherapy was begun in the 1920s by a\\nFrench chemist named Réné-Maurice Gattefosse, who\\nbecame convinced of the healing powers of essential oils\\nwhen he used lavender oil to effectively heal a severe\\nburn on his body . Gattefosse also discovered that essen-\\ntial oils could be absorbed into the bloodstream when ap-\\nplied to the skin, and had medicinal effects inside the\\nbody . Another Frenchman, Dr. Jean V alnet, used essen-\\ntial oils during W orld W ar II to treat soldiers, and wrote a\\nmajor book on the topic in 1964 called Aromatherapie .\\nEuropean biochemist, Marguerite Maury , performed\\nthorough studies of how essential oils influence the body\\nand emotions, and popularized essential oil massages as\\ntherapy . In the 1990s, aromatherapy was one of the\\nfastest-growing alternative health treatments.\\nEssential oils are produced using several techniques.\\nDistillation uses water and steam to remove the oils from\\ndried or fresh plants, and the expression method uses\\nmachines to squeeze the oil out of plants. Other tech-\\nniques may use alcohol or solvents to remove essential\\noils from plant materials.\\nEssential oils are extremely concentrated. It would\\ntake roughly thirty cups of herbal tea to equal the con-\\ncentration of plant essence in one drop of essential oil.\\nSome essential oils made from rose plants require 4,000\\npounds of rose petals to make one pound of essential oil,\\nand are thus very expensive. Lavender is one of the easi-\\nest essential oils to produce, because it only takes one\\nhundred pounds of plant material to produce one pound\\nof essential oil. Essential oils are generally very complex\\nchemically , containing many different substances and\\ncompounds. Some experts have theorized that essential\\noils are the lifeblood of a plant, and contain compounds\\nthat the plant uses to fight infections and drive away\\ngerms and parasites. Scientific research has isolated hun-\\ndreds of chemicals in essential oils, and has shown many\\nessential oils to have anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-\\nparasitic properties. Some essential oils contain more\\nthan 200 identified chemical substances.\\nAlthough there are hundreds of essential oils that\\nare used regularly in healing treatments and perfumes,\\nsome of the more commonly used essential oils are\\nlavender, chamomile , peppermint , tea tree oil , euca-\\nlyptus , geranium, jasmine, rose, lemon, orange, rose-\\nmary, frankincense, and sandalwood.\\nGeneral use\\nEssential oils are used in several healing systems,\\nincluding aromatherapy , A yurvedic medicine, and mas-\\nsage therapy . Essential oils are used for skin and scalp\\nconditions including acne , athlete’s foot , burns , cuts,\\ndandruff , eczema , insect bites, parasites, sunburn ,\\nwarts, and wrinkles. They are recommended for muscle,\\njoint, and circulation problems such as arthritis, high\\nblood pressure, cellulite , aches and pains, and varicose\\nveins . For respiratory problems and infections, various\\nessential oils are prescribed for allergies , asthma , ear-\\nache, sinus infections, congestion, and colds and flu. Es-\\nsential oils are also used to improve digestion, promote\\nhormonal balance, and tone the nervous system in condi-\\ntions including anxiety , depression , sexual\\ndysfunction, and exhaustion.\\nEssential oils can be used as quick and effective\\nmood enhancers, for increasing energy and alertness or\\nreducing stress and promoting relaxation. Essential oils\\ncan be used as perfumes and lotions, and can be used as\\nincense to improve the atmosphere in houses and offices.\\nIn 2002, several reports were made on the benefits\\nof tea tree oil in fighting infections. Although still pre-\\nliminary , these reports will help pave the way to greater\\nacceptance of essential oils in the mainstream medical\\ncommunity . In the case of tea tree oil, one small study\\nshowed its effectiveness in fighting orthopedic (bone,\\njoint, and soft tissue) infections. Another recent study\\nshowed promising results for tea tree oil gel in topical\\ntreatment of recurrent herpes labialis.\\nPreparations\\nEssential oils work by entering the body in two\\nways, through the nose and through the skin. The nose is\\na powerful sense organ, and the sense of smell is con-\\nnected directly to the limbic system of the brain, which\\nhelps control emotions, memory , and several functions in\\nthe body . Research has shown that aromas and the sense\\nof smell influence memory recall, moods, and bodily re-\\nsponses such as heart rate, respiration, hormone levels,\\nand stress reactions. Essential oils with their potent aro-\\nmas can be used to enhance moods, promote relaxation,\\nand increase energy levels.\\nEssential oils are also absorbed by the skin, and act\\nmedicinally once they are absorbed into the body . For in-\\nstance, eucalyptus oil, long used in common cough and\\ncold remedies, can be rubbed on the chest to break up\\ncongestion and mucus inside the lungs. Some essential\\noils, such as tea tree oil, lavender, and thyme, have nat-\\nural antiseptics in them, and can be applied to cuts,\\nburns, and sores to disinfect and promote healing.\\nBecause essential oils are very strong and concen-\\ntrated, they should be diluted with base oils before rub-\\nbing them directly on the body . Base oils are gentle and\\ninexpensive oils, and common ones include almond, jojo-\\nba, grapeseed, sunflower, and sesame oil . Mineral oil is\\nnot recommended as a base oil.

Essential oils can be\\nadded to hot-and-cold compresses for injuries and aches.\\nSome essential oils, like tea tree, fennel, and peppermint\\noil, can be combined with a mixture of water and apple\\ncider vinegar and used as mouthwash. For colds and con-\\ngestion in the lungs or sinuses, essential oils can be in-\\nhaled by adding a few drops to a pot of boiling water,\\nand covering the head with a towel over the pot and\\nbreathing the vapors.\\nConsumers should search for essential oils made by\\nreputable manufacturers. Essential oils should be certi-\\nfied to be 100% pure, without chemical additives or syn-\\nthetic fragrances. The highest quality oils are generally\\nobtained from distillation and cold pressing methods.\\nPrecautions\\nEssential oils should not be taken internally , by\\nmouth, rectum or vagina, unless under medical supervi-\\nsion. Essential oils should be kept away from the eyes. If\\nan essential oil gets into the eyes, they should be rinsed\\nimmediately with cold water. Essential oils should be\\nused with care on broken or damaged skin.\\nSome essential oils have not been thoroughly tested\\nand may be toxic. The oils to be avoided include arnica,\\nbitter almond, calamus, cinnamon, clove, mugwort ,\\nsage , wintergreen , and wormwood . Pregnant women\\nshould avoid these and basil, fennel, marjoram, myrrh,\\noregano, star anise, and tarragon. In general, any essen-\\ntial oils that have not been tested or lack adequate infor-\\nmation should be avoided.\\nSome essential oils may cause the skin to become\\nphotosensitive, or more sensitive to sunlight and more\\nlikely to become sunburned. Essential oils that are pho-\\ntosensitizing include bergamot, orange, lemon, lime,\\ngrapefruit, and angelica root. These oils should be\\navoided before exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light\\nsuch as in tanning beds. People with sun-related skin\\nproblems should avoid these oils.\\nThose with health conditions should use care with\\nessential oils. Steam inhalation of essential oils is not\\nrecommended for asthma sufferers. The essential oils of\\nrosemary , fennel and sage should be avoided by those\\nwith epilepsy.\\nPregnant and nursing women should use caution\\nwith essential oils, because their skin and bodies are\\nmore sensitive and some oils may cause adverse reac-\\ntions. Essential oils should not be used during the first\\nthree months of pregnancy , and after that they should\\nonly be used when heavily diluted with base oils.\\nW omen with histories of miscarriage should not use es-\\nsential oils during pregnancy at all. Pregnant women\\nshould perform skin tests before using essential oils. Es-\\nsential oils are not recommended for nursing mothers.\\nEssential oils should be used with care on children.\\nThey are not recommended for children under one year\\nof age, and should be heavily diluted with base oils when\\nused as a skin massage or lotion for children.\\nEssential oils should be stored out of the reach of chil-\\ndren.

W ells\\nEucalyptus\\nDescription\\nThe eucalyptus tree is a large, fast-growing ever-\\ngreen that is native to Australia and T asmania. The tree\\ncan grow to 375-480 feet (125-160 meters). Eucalyptus\\nbelongs to the myrtle (Myrtaceae) family . There are\\nmore than 300 species of eucalyptus, and Eucalyptus\\nglobulus is the most well-known species. One species (E.\\namygdalin ) is the tallest tree known in the world. The\\ntree grows best in areas with an average temperature of\\n60°F (15°C).\\nEucalyptus trees constitute over 75% of the tree\\npopulation of Australia. The eucalyptus tree is also\\nknown in Australia as the blue gum tree or malee. Other\\nnames for eucalyptus include Australian fever tree and\\nstringy bark tree. The name is actually derived from the\\nGreek word “eucalyptos, ” which means “well covered, ”\\nand refers to the cuplike membrane that covers the bud-\\nding flowers of the tree.\\nThe bluish green leaves carry the medicinal proper-\\nties of the tree and grow to a length of 6-12 inches (15-\\n30 cm). While the leathery leaves are the sole food for\\nkoala bears, the leaves also contain a fragrant volatile oil\\nthat has antiseptic, expectorant, antibacterial, anti-in-\\nflammatory , deodorant, diuretic, and antispasmodic\\nproperties. Other constituents of the leaves include tan-\\nnins, phenolic acids, flavonoids (eucalyptin, hyperin, hy-\\nperoside, quercitin, quercitrin, rutin), sesquiterpenes,\\naldehydes, and ketones.\\nEucalyptus oil is obtained through a steam distilla-\\ntion process that removes the oil from the fresh, mature\\nleaves and branch tips of older trees. Approximately 25\\nspecies of eucalyptus trees in Australia are grown for\\ntheir oil.\\nThere are three grades of eucalyptus oil: medicinal,\\nwhich contains the compound eucalyptol (also called ci-\\nneol); industrial, in which a component of the oil is used\\nin mining operations; and aromatic, which is used in per-\\nfumes and fragrant soap products. These oils vary great-\\nly in character. When choosing an oil for therapeutic use,\\nit is important to know from what species the oil was de-\\nrived. Species used medicinally include E. globulus ,\\nwhich contains up to 70% eucalyptol; E. polybractea ,\\nwhich contains 85% eucalyptol; and E. Smithii. Eucalpy-\\ntus amygdalina and E. dives contain little eucalyptol and\\nare used to separate metallic sulfides from ores in the\\nmining industry . Eucalyptus citriodora contains a\\nlemon-scented oil and is an ingredient in perfumes, as is\\nE. odorata and E. Sturtiana. T wo species,E. dives and E.\\nradiata, have oils with a strong peppermint odor.\\nThe most common species grown for its medicinal\\noil is Eucalyptus globulus . The eucalyptol found in this\\nspecies is a chief ingredient in many over-the-counter\\ncold and cough remedies, such as cough lozenges, chest\\nrubs, and decongestants. It acts to stimulate blood flow\\nand protects against infection and germs. The British\\nPharmocopoeia requires that commercial eucalyptus oils\\ncontain 55% eucalyptol by volume.\\nOrigins\\nThe Australian aborigines have used eucalyptus for\\nhundreds of years as a remedy for fever, wounds ,\\ncoughs, asthma , and joint pain . Australian settlers\\nnamed the eucalyptus the fever tree because of its dis-\\nease-fighting properties. Baron Ferdinand von Miller, a\\nGerman botanist and explorer, was responsible for mak-\\ning the properties of eucalyptus known to the world in\\nthe mid-1800s. Likening eucalyptus’ scent to that of ca-\\njaput oil (a disinfectant), von Miller suggested that euca-\\nlyptus might also be used as a disinfectant in fever dis-\\ntricts. Seeds of the tree were sent to Algiers, France and\\nplanted. The trees thrived and, because of the drying ac-\\ntion of the roots, turned one of the marshiest areas of Al-\\ngiers into a dry and healthy environment, thereby driving\\naway malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Eucalyptus trees\\nwere then planted in temperate areas around the world to\\nprevent malaria . As a result, eucalyptus trees are now\\ncultivated in China, India, Portugal, Spain, Egypt, South\\nand North Africa, Algeria, South America, and in the\\nsouthern portion of the United States.\\nCommercial production of eucalyptus began in Vic-\\ntoria, Australia in 1860. The nineteenth century eclectic\\ndoctors adopted eucalyptus as a treatment for fevers,\\nlaryngitis , asthma, chronic bronchitis , whooping\\ncough , gonorrhea , ulcers, gangrenous tissue, edema ,\\nand gastrointestinal disturbances. European doctors used\\neucalyptus oil to sterilize their surgical and medical\\nequipment. Eucalyptus leaves were often made into cig-\\nars or cigarettes and smoked to relieve asthma and\\nbronchial congestion.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 715\\nEucalyptus\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 715'),\n",

When applied to the skin,\\neucalyptus stimulates blood flow and creates a warm feel-\\ning to the area, relieving pain in muscles and joints.\\nModern medicines around the world have included\\neucalyptus in their practices. Indian ayurvedics use euca-\\nlyptus to treat headaches resulting from colds. Eucalyp-\\ntus is listed in the Indian Pharmacopoeia as an expecto-\\nrant and in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia as a skin irritant\\nused in nerve pain. In France, eucalyptus leaves are ap-\\nplied topically to relieve congestion from colds and to\\ntreat acute bronchial disease. A standardized eucalyptus\\ntea is licensed in Germany to treat bronchitis and throat\\ninflammations. Eucalyptus is also an ingredient in Ger-\\nman herbal cough preparations. The German Commis-\\nsion E has approved the internal use of eucalyptus to\\ntreat congestion of the respiratory tract, and the external\\nuse to treat rheumatic complaints. In the United States,\\neucalyptus is a component of many decongestant and ex-\\npectorating cough and cold remedies, such as cough\\ndrops, cough syrups, and vapor baths.

Odle\\nEucommia bark\\nDescription\\nEucommmia bark is the gray , grooved bark of the\\ntree Eucommia ulmoides , commonly called the hardy\\nrubber tree or the gutta-percha tree. The Chinese name\\nfor eucommia bark is Du Zhong . This name refers to a\\nT aoist monk who was said to be immortal, suggesting\\nthat the herb provides long life, good health, and vitality .\\nThe tree is a member of the rubber family and is native\\nto the mountainous regions of China. It normally grows\\nto about 50 ft (15 m) in height. Small patches of bark are\\nharvested from trees over 10 years old in late summer\\nand early autumn. The outer bark is peeled away and the\\nsmooth inner bark is dried. This inner bark contains a\\npure white, elastic latex that is thought to contain the\\ncompounds that account for eucommia bark’s healing\\nproperties. Older, thicker inner bark with more latex is\\nconsidered more desirable for the herbalist to use than\\nyounger, thinner bark.\\nAlthough traditionally only the bark of E. ulmoides\\nwas used for healing, research in the later half of the 1990s\\nin Japan indicates that the leaves also have healing proper-\\nties. The green leaves are shiny , narrow , and pointed. The\\ntree’s flowers are very small and are not used in healing.\\nGeneral use\\nEucommia bark has been used in traditional Chi-\\nnese herbalism for over 3,000 years. Since the tree does\\nnot grow widely outside China, this herb was not used in\\nother cultures until recently .\\nEucommia bark is strongly associated with the kid-\\nneys and to a lesser extent with the liver. In Chinese\\nmedicine, the kidneys store jing. Jing is an essential life\\nsource and associated with whole body growth and de-\\nvelopment, as well as normal sexual and reproductive\\nfunctioning. The kidney and liver jing also affects the\\nbones, ligaments, and tendons.\\nIn the Chinese system of health, yin aspects must be\\nkept in balance with yang aspects. Ill health occurs when\\nthe energies and elements of the body are out of balance\\nor in disharmony . Health is restored by taking herbs and\\ntreatments that restore that balance.\\nEucommia bark is the primary herb used to increase\\nyang functions in the body . However, it also supports yin\\nfunctions. Eucommia bark helps to build strong bones\\nand a flexible skeleton with strong ligaments and ten-\\ndons. It is a primary herb used to heal tissues that are\\nslow to mend after an injury or that have weakened\\nthrough stress or age. It is given to treat lower back and\\nleg pain, stiffness, arthritis, and knee problems including\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2718\\nEucommia bark\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nDiuretic—A substance that promotes urination.\\nExpectorant—A substance that promotes the cough-\\ning up of mucous or other fluids from the lungs.\\nFebrifuge—A substance that reduces fevers.\\nInfusion—An herbal tea created by steeping herbs\\nin hot water .

Its Latin\\nname is derived from the Greek word oinos for wine and\\nthera for hunt and reflects the folk belief that the herb\\ncontinual dislocation. Eucommia bark is also believed to\\nhave diuretic properties that aid in reducing swelling. Al-\\nthough it can be used alone, eucommia bark is most\\noften used in conjunction with other herbs that support\\nits functions.\\nIn addition to healing tissues, eucommia bark has\\ntwo other major functions. In pregnant women it is given\\nto calm the fetus, soothe the uterus, and prevent miscar-\\nriage. Eucommia bark also has the ability to reduce\\nblood pressure. This property has been investigated since\\n1974, and may be related to its mild diuretic action. Eu-\\ncommia bark is used in almost all Chinese formulas to\\nlower blood pressure.\\nOther modern uses of eucommia bark include treat-\\nment of impotence, premature ejaculation, and as a mild\\nanti-inflammatory . It is included in tonics that boost the\\nimmune system and generally improve wellness. How-\\never, there is little rigorous scientific research to support\\nthese uses.\\nIn the late 1990s Japanese researchers became inter-\\nested in eucommia bark. In 2000, researchers at Nihon\\nUniversity in Chiba, Japan, published two studies showing\\nthat both the leaves and the bark of Eucommia ulmoides\\ncontained a compound that encourages the development\\nof collagen in rats. Collagen is an important part of con-\\nnective tissues such as tendons and ligaments. However,\\nthey found that the compound was present in much greater\\nquantities in fresh leaves and fresh bark, and that much of\\nit was destroyed during the drying process.\\nIn modern Japan, eucommia leaves are also believed\\nto help with weight loss by reducing the urge to eat. For\\nthis reason, in the late 1990s eucommia leaves became\\nan increasingly popular herb there. However, there are\\nno scientific studies to support this function of the herb.\\nPreparations\\nEucommia bark is harvested and dried. Before boil-\\ning, it is sliced to expose the inside of the bark. The bark\\nis then boiled to make a decoction. Generally this decoc-\\ntion is combined with other herbs and extracts to create\\nyang enhancing tonics to treat kidney and liver deficien-\\ncies and impotence.\\nPrecautions\\nEucommia bark has a long history of use with no\\nsubstantial reported problems.\\nSide effects\\nNo side effects have been reported with the use of\\neucommia bark.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 719\\nEvening primrose oil\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nCollagen —Collagen is a white, fibrous protein\\nthat is found in skin, bones, ligaments, tendons,\\ncartilage, and all other connective tissue.\\nDecoction —Decoctions are made by boiling an\\nherb, then straining the solid material out.\\nDiuretic—A diuretic is any substance that increas-\\nes the production of urine.\\nY ang aspects—Y ang aspects are qualities such as\\nwarmth, light, and activity .\\nYin aspects—Yin aspects are the opposite of yang\\naspects and are represented by qualities such as\\ncold, stillness, darkness and passiveness.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 719'),\n",

(Illustration by\\nElectronic Illustrators Group. The Gale Group.)\\nThe earliest forms of exercise stressed activities that\\ninvolved stretching and light muscle resistance. Next\\ncame martial arts that promoted self-defense. In nearly\\nall forms of Asian exercise routines, some type of medi-\\ntation was a major component because the ancients be-\\nlieved physical and mental health went together. The an-\\ncient Greek and Roman civilizations advocated vigorous\\nphysical activity since exercise was associated with mili-\\ntary training. The Greeks also believed that a healthy\\nbody would promote a healthy mind.\\n“Physical culture” was popular in the nineteenth and\\nearly twentieth centuries. Medical journals showed exercise\\nmachines in the 1800s in Europe and North America. Al-\\nthough weight training became popular with a small number\\nof people in the 1940s, it was not until the 1960s that regular\\nexercise programs began to flourish throughout the United\\nStates. Gymnasiums, once used mainly by male weight\\nlifters and boxers as training facilities, now are common\\nthroughout the United States. T oday’s gyms and health clubs\\noffer a wide range of exercise activities for men and women\\nthat can fit every lifestyle, age group, and exertion level.\\nBenefits\\nThe medical community recognizes that regular ex-\\nercise, along with a proper diet, is one of the two most\\nimportant factors in maintaining good physical and men-\\ntal health, and in preventing and managing many dis-\\neases. Most certified physical trainers advocate at least\\n20 minutes of exercise at least three times a week. But\\nfor people who have a sedentary lifestyle, even walking\\nfor 10 minutes a day has health benefits. One study of\\n13,000 people followed for more than eight years\\nshowed that people who walk 30 minutes a day have a\\nsignificantly reduced risk of premature death than people\\nwho did not exercise regularly .\\nW alking and other cardiovascular exercises can re-\\nduce the risk of heart disease , some cancers, hyperten-\\nsion (high blood pressure), arthritis,osteoporosis, stroke,\\nand depression.

Y oga\\nand martial arts are basically muscle stretching routines,\\nwalking and running are primarily aerobic, and weight\\nlifting is mainly resistance. However, exercises such as\\nswimming are considered crossover activities since they\\nbuild muscle and provide a good aerobic, or cardiovascu-\\nlar, workout. Certified physical trainers usually advocate\\na combination program that involves stretching, aero-\\nbics, and at least some resistance activity for 30-60 min-\\nutes a day three times a week.\\nStretching and meditative exercises\\nThe most common types of alternative health exer-\\ncises are the ancient disciplines of yoga and the martial\\narts (such as t’ai chi and qigong).\\nYOGA. The ancient East Indian discipline of yoga is\\nprobably the most widely practiced exercise advocated\\nby alternative health practitioners. This may be because\\nthere is a heavy emphasis on mental conditioning as well\\nas physical exertion. Y oga is the practice of incorporating\\nmind, body , and spirit through a series of physical pos-\\ntures, breathing exercises, and meditation. It improves\\nmuscle flexibility , strength, and tone while calming the\\nmind and spirit. Most contemporary stress reduction\\ntechniques are based on yoga principles.\\nThere are a variety of yoga styles, each with its own\\nunique focus. In the United States,hatha yoga is the most\\npracticed. The pace is slow and involves a lot of stretching\\nand breathing exercises. Much like the Chinese philosophy\\nof yin and yang, hatha yoga strives to balance the opposite\\nforces of ha (sun) and tha (moon). Astanga, or power yoga,\\ninvolves more intense yoga postures done in rapid succes-\\nsion. Its vigorous workout is especially good in developing\\nmuscle strength. Iyengar yoga promotes body alignment\\nwhile kripalu yoga develops mind, body , and spirit aware-\\nness. Pranayama yoga is a series of breathing exercises de-\\nsigned to increase vitality and energy .\\nY oga helps strengthen the heart and slow respira-\\ntion. Studies have shown it is beneficial in treating a va-\\nriety of conditions, including heart disease, hyperten-\\nsion, arthritis, depression, fatigue, chronic pain , and\\ncarpal-tunnel syndrome. A 2001 study at the Cleveland\\nClinic Foundation in Ohio looked at yoga’s effect on\\npeople suffering from lower back pain and pain due to\\nconditions like carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis.\\nAfter a four-week period, investigators noted that yoga\\nhelped lessen pain, improve participants’ moods and de-\\ncreased pain medication requirements.\\nThere are four main groups of yoga postures, also\\ncalled asanas: standing, seated, reclining prone, and re-\\nclining supine. Other groups include forward bends,\\nback bends, side bends, twists, inverted, and balancing.\\nWithin each group there are dozens of different yoga\\nposes at beginning and advanced levels.\\nMARTIAL ARTS. While the words “martial arts” may\\nbe associated with conflict, they usually are graceful ex-\\nercise movements that keep the body and mind strong\\nand healthy . They can be performed by young and old.\\nMartial arts range from simple stretching and meditative\\nexercises to complicated and demanding exercises re-\\nquiring more physical activity and mental concentration.\\nProbably the most popular among alternative health\\nparticipants is t’ai chi, derived from the Chinese philoso-\\nphy of T aoism and based on the concept of yin and yang.\\nT’ai chi has a self-defense aspect based on counteracting\\nan opponent’s attack and then counterattacking, all in the\\nsame movement. As an exercise to maintain health, t’ai\\nchi strengthens muscles and joints. It requires deep\\nbreathing techniques that increase blood circulation,\\nbenefiting the heart, lungs, and other organs. New re-\\nsearch states that t’ai chi may improve physical function-\\ning, like bending and lifting, in older age.\\nAnother martial art growing in popularity in the\\nUnited States is qigong (pronounced chee kung), al-\\nthough it has several forms that are more T aoist and Bud-\\ndhist than martial. Qigong is a gentle exercise program\\nthat can increase vitality , enhance the immune system,\\nand relieve stress when performed regularly . In China,\\nthere are hospitals that use qigong to treat terminal ill-\\nnesses, particularly cancer.\\nCardiovascular and aerobic\\nAerobic, also called cardiovascular, exercises use a\\nvariety of muscle groups continuously and rhythmically ,\\nincreasing heart rate and breathing. Specific aerobic ac-\\ntivities include walking, jogging, running, bicycling,\\nswimming, tennis, and cross-country skiing. Another\\npopular form is aerobic dance exercise. Routines should\\nlast 10-60 minutes and be performed at least three times\\na week. Aerobic exercise is especially beneficial for los-\\ning weight and building endurance.\\nAerobic exercises can be done outside a formal set-\\nting, with little or no equipment.

Exercising with a group often helps with\\nmotivation. Also, health clubs usually offer a variety of\\nstationary aerobic equipment, such as bikes, treadmills,\\nstair climbers, and rowing machines.\\nResistance\\nResistance exercises generally are accomplished by\\nlifting weights such as barbells and dumbbells, or by\\nusing a variety of resistance machines. They can also be\\ndone using only the body as resistance, such as doing\\npush-ups, pull-ups, and sit-ups. Resistance exercise is\\nparticularly good for building muscles. For patients with\\nkidney disease, weight lifting offers added benefit.\\nChronic kidney disease can lead to muscle wasting,\\nwhich is compounded by low-protein diets that may be\\ndescribed for these patients. A 2001 study demonstrated\\nthat resistance training can improve muscle mass in kid-\\nney disease patients.\\nUnlike aerobics, which can be done daily , weight-\\nlifting exercises require a period for the muscles to rest\\nand rebuild. A total-body workout should be done every\\nother day , or two to three times a week. A more ad-\\nvanced workout would exercise the lower body muscles\\none day and upper body muscles the next. It is also im-\\nportant to do 5-10 minutes each of warm-up and cool-\\ndown exercises, which will help increase flexibility and\\ndecrease soreness and fatigue.\\nPreparations\\nNo advance preparations are required for exercising.\\nHowever, a trainer can test a person’s strength level and\\noutline an appropriate program. Proper shoes are essen-\\ntial, especially for running. Any exercise should start with\\na warm-up of 5-10 minutes. Anyone considering a regular\\nexercise program should consult first with a doctor, and\\npossibly a sports podiatrist, to avoid strain and injury .\\nPersons with serious health problems, such as heart dis-\\nease, diabetes, AIDS, asthma , and arthritis should only\\nbegin an exercise regimen with their doctor’s approval.\\nPrecautions\\nIn most people, the main exercise precaution is to\\navoid strain and overexertion. Exercise doesn’t need to be\\nstrenuous to be beneficial. People with certain chronic\\nhealth problems should take special precautions. Diabetics\\nshould closely monitor their blood sugar levels before and\\nafter exercising. Heart disease patients should never exer-\\ncise to the point of chest pain. Exercise can induce asth-\\nma. It is essential for people with asthma to get their doc-\\ntor’s permission before starting an exercise program. It\\nalso is important for people to be shown the proper form\\nin any activity to avoid strain and possible injury , especial-\\nly when using exercise equipment. People also should\\nknow what parts of the body might be stressed by a partic-\\nular exercise. They can then use supplemental exercises or\\nstretches to add balance to the exercise program.\\nSide effects\\nThe primary adverse effects of exercising can be\\nsore muscles and stiff joints a day or two after beginning\\nan exercise routine. These pains may last for several\\ndays. Other minor problems can include headaches,\\ndizziness, fatigue, and nausea, usually indicating the ex-\\nercise routine is too strenuous. A person can agitate old\\ninjuries or create new ones by improperly using equip-\\nment or wearing inadequately cushioned shoes.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nThere almost is universal acceptance by allopathic\\nand homeopathic health practitioners that exercise can be\\nbeneficial to overall good health. Thousands of studies\\nduring the past several decades link regular exercise to\\nreduced risks for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity,\\ndepression, hypertension, and osteoporosis. For exam-\\nple, a 1998 study by Harvard University of more than\\n11,000 people showed that people who exercise for an\\nhour a day cut their risk of stroke in half over people\\nwho do not exercise regularly .\\nT raining & certification\\nNo special training or certification is required for\\nexercising.

It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae\\nplant family , which also includes the foxglove plant.\\nEyebright grows to a height of 4-8 inches (10-20\\ncm) and has small white or purple flowers with red\\nspots. These petals resemble bloodshot eyes, suggesting\\nthe plant’s name and its eye-clearing action. Downy\\nhairs cover the stems, which produce toothed leaves.\\nEyebright is a semiparasitic plant. This means that it\\nis nourished by the roots of other plants. Generally , it\\ndoes not grow well if transplanted from the wild. The\\nplant is harvested during the late summer or fall when\\nthe flowers are in bloom. The whole plant is cut off just\\nabove the root and then dried.\\nEyebright contains vitamins A, C, D, and B com-\\nplex; iron; silicon; and traces of iodine , copper , and\\nzinc. Other components of eyebright include tannins, iri-\\ndoid glycosides, the flavonoids rutin and quercetin, es-\\nsential fatty acids , glycoside aucuboside, caffeic and\\nferulic acids, sterols, choline, and a volatile oil.\\nHistory\\nThe Latin name Euphrasia is derived from the\\nGreek word “Euphrosyne, ” meaning gladness.

The poet Milton men-\\ntions eyebright in his book P aradise Lost, in which the\\narchangel Michael gives eyebright to Adam to cure an\\neye infection. In 1485, eyebright was listed in a German\\nbook on medicinal herbs. Many sixteenth century herbal-\\nists championed eyebright as a treatment for various eye\\ndiseases. During the time of Queen Elizabeth, an eye-\\nbright ale was popular. Dried eyebright was often com-\\nbined with tobacco and smoked to provide relief for\\nbronchial colds.\\nGeneral use\\nModern herbalists still prescribe eyebright as a popu-\\nlar remedy for eye irritations and disorders, such as con-\\njunctivitis and blepharitis. Icelanders use the juice from\\nthe pressed plant to treat most eye afflictions. Scottish\\npeople make an infusion in milk for inflamed or weak\\neyes.

It is also used to relieve stress,\\nmigraine headache, premenstrual syndrome(PMS) and\\nsinus congestion. It may involve a whole massage session,\\na portion of a whole-body massage or a part of a facial\\ntreatment. Facial massage can be done by a professional\\nmassage therapist, an esthetician, or a cosmetologist. Sim-\\nple massage can also be done at home. Massage of the face\\nis usually done with the hands; however, mechanical mas-\\nsaging devices are also used in beauty salons or spas. A\\nsmall amount of oil or lotion is often applied to facilitate\\nmovement over the delicate facial areas.\\nIn Eastern therapies, facial massage is part of a full-\\nbody treatment in which pressure points on the face and\\nneck are stimulated in order to release blockages in the\\nflow of qi, or vital energy . Lotions or oils are not used on\\nthe face in acupressure , shiatsu , or yoga techniques of\\nfacial massage.\\nOrigins\\nMassage has been used for pain relief, healing and\\ncosmetic improvement by people of all cultures since an-\\ncient times. The first written record of massage therapy\\nis a Chinese medical text dating from the third century\\nB.C. The ancient Greeks, Persians, Japanese, and Indians\\nalso recorded the use of massage treatment in great detail\\nin their early medical literature.\\nThe W estern version of facial massage as a cosmetic\\ntreatment is a relatively recent twentieth-century innova-\\ntion. It has become especially popular in Europe. Many of\\nthe best-known European practitioners have set up shop in\\nthe United States and taught others.

A regular massage simply includes massage of\\nthe face, usually at the beginning or the end of the mas-\\nsage session.\\nFor a W estern facial massage, a gentle effleurage\\n(gliding) movement is most often used. T o perform the\\nfacial massage, the strokes must be gentle as well as\\nstimulating, in order not to stretch the skin.

If the person to be massaged wears contact lens,\\nask her or him to remove them.\\n• Position: The most comfortable position has the client\\nlying down on a massage table or sitting in a chair. Fa-\\ncial massage can be done, however, on any flat surface\\nlike a clean floor.\\n• Using a small amount of cleanser, gently wash the\\nclient’s face.

It is also a spiritual practice in\\nmany religions.\\nOrigins\\nUsed for thousands of years, fasting is one of the old-\\nest therapies in medicine. Many of the great doctors of an-\\ncient times and many of the oldest healing systems have\\nrecommended it as an integral method of healing and pre-\\nvention. Hippocrates, the father of W estern medicine, be-\\nlieved fasting enabled the body to heal itself. Paracelsus,\\nanother great healer in the W estern tradition, wrote 500\\nyears ago that “fasting is the greatest remedy , the physician\\nwithin. ” A yurvedic medicine, the world’s oldest healing\\nsystem, has long advocated fasting as a major treatment.\\nFasting has also been used in nearly every religion\\nin the world, including Christianity , Judaism, Buddhism,\\nand Islam. Many of history’s great spiritual leaders fast-\\ned for mental and spiritual clarity , including Jesus, Bud-\\ndha, and Mohammed. In one of the famous political acts\\nof the last century , the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi\\nfasted for 21 days to promote peace.\\nFasting has been used in Europe as a medical treat-\\nment for years. Many spas and treatment centers, particu-\\nlarly those in Germany , Sweden, and Russia, use medical-\\nly supervised fasting. Fasting has gained popularity in\\nAmerican alternative medicine over the past several\\ndecades, and many doctors feel it is beneficial. Fasting is a\\ncentral therapy in detoxification, a healing method found-\\ned on the principle that the build up of toxic substances in\\nthe body is responsible for many illnesses and conditions.\\nBenefits\\nFasting can be used for nearly every chronic condi-\\ntion, including allergies , anxiety, arthritis, asthma, de-\\npression, diabetes, headaches, heart disease , high cho-\\nlesterol, low blood sugar, digestive disorders, mental ill-\\nness, and obesity. Fasting is an effective and safe weight\\nloss method. It is frequently prescribed as a detoxifica-\\ntion treatment for those with conditions that may be in-\\nfluenced by environmental factors, such as cancer and\\nmultiple chemical sensitivity . Fasting has been used\\nsuccessfully to help treat people who have been exposed\\nto high levels of toxic materials due to accident or occu-\\npation. Fasting is thought to be beneficial as a preventa-\\ntive measure to increase overall health, vitality , and re-\\nsistance to disease. Fasting is also used as a method of\\nmental and spiritual rejuvenation.\\nDescription\\nThe principle of fasting is simple. When the intake\\nof food is temporarily stopped, many systems of the\\nbody are given a break from the hard work of digestion.\\nThe extra energy gives the body the chance to heal and\\nrestore itself, and burning stored calories gets rid of toxic\\nsubstances stored in the body .\\nThe digestive tract is the part of the body most ex-\\nposed to environmental threats, including bacteria, virus-\\nes, parasites, and toxins. It requires the most immune\\nsystem support. When food is broken down in the in-\\ntestines, it travels through the blood to the liver, the\\nlargest organ of the body’s natural detoxification system.\\nThe liver breaks down and removes the toxic by-prod-\\nucts produced by digestion, including natural ones and\\nthe chemicals now present in the food supply . During\\nfasting, the liver and immune system are essentially\\nfreed to detoxify and heal other parts of the body .\\nMany healers claim that fasting is a particularly use-\\nful therapy for Americans and for the modern lifestyle,\\nsubjected to heavy diets, overeating, and constant expo-\\nsure to food additives and chemicals. Some alternative\\npractitioners have gone so far as to estimate that the av-\\nerage American is carrying 5-10 pounds of toxic sub-\\nstances in their bodies, for which fasting is the quickest\\nand most effective means of removal.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2732\\nFasting\\nEvarts G.

For many centuries, fasting was probably\\na normal occurrence for most people, and the body\\nadapted to it. It is estimated that even very thin people\\ncan survive for 40 days or more without food. The body\\nhas a special mechanism that is initiated when no food is\\neaten. Fasting is not starvation, but rather the body’s\\nburning of stored energy . Starvation occurs when the\\nbody no longer has any stored energy and begins using\\nessential tissues such as organs for an energy source.\\nTherapeutic fasts are stopped long before this happens.\\nMany physiological changes occur in the body dur-\\ning fasting. During the first day or so, the body uses its\\nglycogen reserves, the sugars that are the basic energy\\nsupply . After these are depleted, the body begins using\\nfat. However, the brain, which has high fuel require-\\nments, still needs glucose (sugars converted from glyco-\\ngen). T o obtain glucose for the brain, the body begins to\\nbreak down muscle tissue during the second day of the\\nfast. Thus, during fasting some muscle loss will occur. T o\\nfuel the brain, the body would need to burn over a pound\\nof muscle a day , but the body has developed another way\\nto create energy that saves important muscle mass. This\\nprotein-sparing process is called ketosis, which occurs\\nduring the third day of a fast for men and the second day\\nfor women. In this highly efficient state, the liver begins\\nconverting stored fat and other nonessential tissues into\\nketones, which can be used by the brain, muscles, and\\nheart as energy . It is at this point in the fast that sensations\\nof hunger generally go away , and many people experi-\\nence normal or even increased energy levels. Hormone\\nlevels and certain functions become more stable in this\\nstate as well. The goal of most fasts is to allow the body\\nto reach the ketosis state in order to burn excess fat and\\nunneeded or damaged tissue. Thus, fasts longer than three\\ndays are generally recommended as therapy .\\nW eight loss occurs most rapidly during the first few\\ndays of a fast, up to 2 pounds per day . In following days,\\nthe figure drops to around 0.5 pound per day . An average\\nweight loss of a pound a day for an entire fast can be ex-\\npected. Studies show that cutting back just once a month\\ncan jump-start healthier eating and help rid one’s body of\\na lifetime of extra calories.\\nPerforming a fast\\nFasts can be performed for varying lengths of time,\\ndepending on the person and his or her health require-\\nments. For chronic conditions, therapists recommend\\nfrom two to four weeks to get the most benefits. Seven-\\nday fasts are also commonly performed. A popular fast-\\ning program for prevention and general health is a three-\\nday fast taken four times per year, at the change of each\\nseason. These can be easily performed over long week-\\nends. Preventative fasts of one day per week are used by\\nmany people as well.\\nJuice fasts are also used by many people, although\\nthese are not technically fasts. Juice fasts are less inten-\\nsive than water fasts because the body doesn’t reach the\\nketosis stage. The advantage of juice fasts is that fruit\\nand vegetable drinks can supply extra energy and nutri-\\nents. People can fit a few days of juice fasting into their\\nnormal schedules without significant drops in energy .\\nJuice fasts are also said to have cleansing and detoxify-\\ning effects. The disadvantage of juice fasts is that the\\nbody never gets to the ketosis stage, so these fasters are\\nthought to lack the deep detoxification and healing ef-\\nfects of the water fast.\\nMedical supervision is recommended for any fast\\nover three days. Most alternative medicine practitioners,\\nsuch as homeopaths, naturopathic doctors, and ayurvedic\\ndoctors, can supervise and monitor patients during fasts.\\nThose performing extended fasts and those with health\\nconditions may require blood, urine, and other tests dur-\\ning fasting. There are many alternative health clinics that\\nperform medically supervised fasts as well. Some con-\\nventional medical doctors may also supervise patients\\nduring fasts. Costs and insurance coverage vary , depend-\\ning on the doctor, clinic, and requirements of the patient.\\nPreparations\\nFasts must be entered and exited with care. T o enter\\na fast, the diet should be gradually lightened over a few\\ndays. First, heavy foods such as meats and dairy prod-\\nucts should be eliminated for a day or two. Grains, nuts,\\nand beans should then be reduced for several days. The\\nday before a fast, only easily digested foods like fruits,\\nlight salads, and soups should be eaten. During the fast,\\nonly pure water and occasional herbal teas should be\\ndrunk. If you exercise , keep your workouts during fast-\\ning light and relatively brief, stopping immediately if\\nyou feel dizzy , lightheaded or short of breath.\\nFasts should be ended as gradually as they are en-\\ntered, going from lighter to heavier foods progressively .\\nThe diet after a fast should emphasize fresh, wholesome\\nfoods. Fasters should particularly take care not to overeat\\nwhen they complete a fast.\\nPrecautions\\nFasting isn’t appropriate for everyone and, in some\\ncases, could be harmful. Any person undertaking a first fast\\nlonger than three days should seek medical supervision.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 733\\nFasting\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 733'),\n",

Heart disease, low blood pres-\\nsure, diabetes, end-stage renal disease, iron-deficiency\\nanemia , narcolepsy , and cancer can cause long-term,\\nongoing fatigue symptoms. Acute illnesses such as viral\\nand bacterial infections can also trigger temporary feel-\\nings of exhaustion. In addition, mental disorders such as\\ndepression can also cause fatigue. A 2002 report sug-\\ngests that a disorder called hypocalcaemia may be a fre-\\nquent cause of fatigue.\\nA number of medications, including antihistamines,\\nantibiotics, and blood pressure medications, may cause\\ndrowsiness as a side effect. Individuals already suffering\\nfrom fatigue who are prescribed one of these medica-\\ntions may wish to check with their healthcare providers\\nabout alternative treatments.\\nExtreme fatigue which persists, unabated, for at\\nleast six months, is not the result of a diagnosed disease\\nor illness, and is characterized by flu-like symptoms\\nsuch as swollen lymph nodes, sore throat , and muscle\\nweakness and/or pain may indicate a diagnosis of\\nchronic fatigue syndrome . Chronic fatigue syndrome\\n(or CFS, sometimes called chronic fatigue immune defi-\\nciency syndrome), is a debilitating illness that causes\\noverwhelming exhaustion and a number of neurological\\nand immunological symptoms. Between 1.5 and 2 mil-\\nlion Americans are estimated to suffer from the disorder.\\nIn late 2001, a panel of experts convened and announced\\nthat CFS is definitely associated with the immune sys-\\ntem, and likely caused by a virus or bacteria, though no\\nsingle cause has been identified.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause fatigue is a symptom of a number of differ-\\nent disorders, diseases, and lifestyle choices, diagnosis\\nmay be difficult. A thorough examination and patient\\nhistory by a qualified healthcare provider is the first step\\nin determining the cause of the fatigue. A physician can\\nrule out physical conditions and diseases that feature fa-\\ntigue as a symptom, and can also determine if prescrip-\\ntion drugs, poor dietary habits, work environment, or\\nother external stressors could be triggering the exhaus-\\ntion. Several diagnostic tests may also be required to rule\\nout common physical causes of exhaustion, such as\\nblood tests to check for iron-deficiency anemia.\\nDiagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome is signifi-\\ncantly more difficult. Because there is no specific biolog-\\nical marker or conclusive blood test to check for the dis-\\norder, healthcare providers must rely on the patient’s\\npresentation and severity of symptoms to make a diagno-\\nsis. In many cases, individuals with chronic fatigue syn-\\ndrome go through a battery of invasive diagnostic tests\\nand several years of consultation with medical profes-\\nsionals before receiving a correct diagnosis.\\nT reatment\\nThe treatment of fatigue depends on its direct cause,\\nbut there are several commonly prescribed treatments for\\nnon-specific fatigue, including dietary and lifestyle\\nchanges, the use of essential oils and herbal therapies,\\ndeep breathing exercises, traditional Chinese medicine,\\nand color therapy.\\nDietary changes\\nInadequate or inappropriate nutritional intake can\\ncause fatigue symptoms. T o maintain an adequate energy\\nsupply and promote overall physical well-being, individ-\\nuals should eat a balanced diet and observe the following\\nnutritional guidelines:\\n• Drinking plenty of water. Individuals should try to drink\\n9 to 12 glasses of water a day . Dehydration can reduce\\nblood volume, which leads to feelings of fatigue.\\n• Eating iron-rich foods (i.e., liver, raisins, spinach, apri-\\ncots). Iron enables the blood to transport oxygen\\nthroughout the tissues, organs, and muscles, and dimin-\\nished oxygenation of the blood can result in fatigue.\\n• A voiding high-fat meals and snacks. High-fat foods\\ntake longer to digest, reducing blood flow to the brain,\\nheart, and rest of the body while blood flow is in-\\ncreased to the stomach.\\n• Eating unrefined carbohydrates and proteins together\\nfor sustained energy .\\n• Balancing proteins. Limiting protein to 15-20 grams\\nper meal and two snacks of 15 grams is recommended.\\nNot getting enough protein adds to fatigue. Pregnant or\\nbreastfeeding women should eat more protein.\\n• Getting the recommended daily allowance of B com-\\nplex vitamins (specifically , pantothenic acid , folic\\nacid, thiamine, and vitamin B\\n12). Deficiencies in these\\nvitamins can trigger fatigue.\\n• Getting the recommended daily allowance of selenium,\\nriboflavin , and niacin .

Individuals should only eat when\\nthey’re hungry , and stop when they’re full. An over-\\nstuffed stomach can cause short-term fatigue, and indi-\\nviduals who are overweight are much more likely to\\nregularly experience fatigue symptoms.\\nLifestyle changes\\nLifestyle factors such as a high-stress job, erratic\\nwork hours, lack of social or family support, or erratic\\nsleep patterns can all cause prolonged fatigue. If stress is\\nan issue, a number of relaxation therapies and techniques\\nare available to help alleviate tension, including massage,\\nyoga, aromatherapy, hydrotherapy, progressive relax-\\nation exercises, meditation, and guided imagery. Some\\nmay also benefit from individual or family counseling or\\npsychotherapy sessions to work through stress-related\\nfatigue that is a result of family or social issues.\\nMaintaining healthy sleep patterns is critical to proper\\nrest. Having a set “bedtime” helps to keep sleep on sched-\\nule. A calm and restful sleeping environment is also im-\\nportant to healthy sleep. Above all, the bedroom should be\\nquiet and comfortable, away from loud noises and with\\nadequate window treatments to keep sunlight and street-\\nlights out. Removing distractions from the bedroom such\\nas televisions and telephones can also be helpful.\\nEssential oils\\nAromatherapists, hydrotherapists, and other holistic\\nhealthcare providers may recommend the use of essen-\\ntial oils of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis ), eucalyp-\\ntus blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus), peppermint,( Men-\\ntha x piperata ), or scots pine oil ( Pinus sylvestris ) to\\nstimulate the nervous system and reduce fatigue. These\\noils can be added to bathwater or massage oil as a topical\\napplication. Citrus oils such as lemon, orange, grape-\\nfruit, and lime have a similar effect, and can be added to\\na steam bath or vaporizer for inhalation.\\nHerbal remedies\\nHerbal remedies that act as circulatory stimulants\\ncan offset the symptoms of fatigue in some individuals.\\nAn herbalist may recommend an infusion of ginger (Zin-\\ngiber officinale ) root or treatment with cayenne (Cap-\\nsicum annuum ), balmony ( Chelone glabra ), damiana\\n(Turnera diffusa), ginseng ( P anax ginseng), or rosemary\\n(Rosmarinus officinalis) to treat ongoing fatigue.\\nAn infusion is prepared by mixing the herb with\\nboiling water, steeping it for several minutes, and then\\nremoving the herb from the infusion before drinking. A\\nstrainer, tea ball, or infuser can be used to immerse loose\\nherb in the boiling water before steeping and separating\\nit. A second method of infusion is to mix the loose\\nherbal preparation with cold water first, bringing the\\nmixture to a boil in a pan or teapot, and then separating\\nthe tea from the infusion with a strainer before drinking.\\nCaffeine-containing central nervous system stimu-\\nlants such as tea (Camellia senensis) and cola (Cola niti-\\nda) can provide temporary , short-term relief of fatigue\\nsymptoms. However, long-term use of caffeine can\\ncause restlessness, irritability , and other unwanted side\\neffects, and in some cases may actually work to increase\\nfatigue after the stimulating effects of the caffeine wear\\noff. T o avoid these problems, caffeine intake should be\\nlimited to 300 mg or less a day (the equivalent of 4-8\\ncups of brewed, hot tea).\\nT raditional Chinese medicine\\nChinese medicine regards fatigue as a blockage or\\nmisalignment of qi, or energy flow , inside the human\\nbody . The practitioner of Chinese medicine chooses\\nacupuncture and/or herbal therapy to rebalance the en-\\ntire system. The Chinese formula Minot Bupleurum soup\\n(or Xiao Chia Hu T ang) has been used for nearly 2,000\\nyears for the type of chronic fatigue that comes after the\\nflu. In this condition, the person has low-grade fever ,\\nnausea , and fatigue. There are other formulas that are\\nhelpful in other cases. Acupuncture involves the place-\\nment of a series of thin needles into the skin at targeted\\nlocations on the body known as acupoints in order to\\nharmonize the energy flow within the human body .\\nDeep breathing exercises\\nIndividuals under stress often experience fast, shal-\\nlow breathing. This type of breathing, known as chest\\nbreathing, can lead to shortness of breath, increased\\nmuscle tension, inadequate oxygenation of blood, and\\nfatigue. Breathing exercises can both improve respirato-\\nry function and relieve stress and fatigue.\\nDeep breathing exercises are best performed while\\nlying flat on the back on a hard surface, usually the floor.\\nThe knees are bent, and the body (particularly the mouth,\\nnose, and face) is relaxed. One hand should be placed on\\nthe chest and one on the abdomen to monitor breathing\\ntechnique. With proper breathing techniques, the ab-\\ndomen will rise further than the chest. The individual\\ntakes a series of long, deep breaths through the nose, at-\\ntempting to raise the abdomen instead of the chest. Air is\\nexhaled through the relaxed mouth.

Odle\\nFeldenkrais\\nDefinition\\nThe Feldenkrais method is an educational system that\\nallows the body to move and function more efficiently and\\ncomfortably . Its goal is to re-educate the nervous system\\nand improve motor ability . The system can accomplish\\nmuch more, relieving pressure on joints and weak points,\\nand allowing the body to heal repetitive strain injuries.\\nContinued use of the method can relieve pain and lead to\\nhigher standards of achievement in sports, the martial\\narts, dancing and other physical disciplines.\\nPupils are taught to become aware of their move-\\nments and to become aware of how they use their bodies,\\nthus discovering possible areas of stress and strain. The\\ngoal of Feldenkrais is to take the individual from merely\\nfunctioning, to functioning well, free of pain and restric-\\ntion of movement. Feldenkrais himself stated that his\\ngoal was, “T o make the impossible possible, the possible\\neasy , and the easy , elegant. ”\\nOrigins\\nMoshe Feldenkrais (1904–1984) was a Russian-\\nborn Israeli physicist and engineer who was also an ac-\\ntive soccer player and judo master. He devised his sys-\\ntem in response to his own recurring knee injury , which\\nhad restricted his movement and caused him great pain\\nover a long period of time. Feldenkrais believed that re-\\npeated muscle patterns cause the parts of the brain con-\\ntrolling those muscles to stay in a fixed pattern as well.\\nHe thought that the more the muscles are used, the more\\nparts of the brain can be activated. He devised a method\\nof re-educating the neuromuscular system and re-evalu-\\nating movement to increase efficiency and reduce stress,\\nusing his knowledge of mechanics and engineering, and\\napplying some of his martial arts training.\\nBenefits\\nThis method of re-educating the nervous system can\\nbe beneficial to a wide range of people, including ath-\\nletes, children, the elderly , martial artists, those who are\\nhandicapped, people with special needs, and those suffer-\\ning from degenerative diseases. It has also proved popular\\nwith artists, particularly musicians, a number of whom\\nhave used Feldenkrais to improve their performance.\\nThe Feldenkrais Guild of North America (FGNA)\\nstates that over half of the those who turn to Feldenkrais\\npractitioners are seeking relief from pain. Many people\\nwho have pain from an injury compensate by changing\\ntheir movements to limit pain. Often these changed move-\\nments remain after the pain from the original injury is\\ngone, and new pain may occur. Feldenkrais helps students\\nbecome aware of the changed movements and allows them\\nto learn new movements that relieve their pain. Apart from\\nthe obvious physical benefits of more efficient movement\\nand freedom from pain and restriction, Feldenkrais practi-\\ntioners assert that there are other positive benefits for over-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2738\\nFeldenkrais Moshe Feldenkrais was born on the border be-\\ntween Russia and Poland. When he was only a boy of\\n13, he traveled to P alestine on foot. The journey took a\\nyear , and once there, young Feldenkrais worked as a la-\\nborer and cartographer , also tutoring others in mathe-\\nmatics. Moving to France in 1933, he graduated in me-\\nchanical and electrical engineering from the Ecole des\\nT ravaux Publiques de P aris.\\nFeldenkrais became the first person to open a Judo\\ncenter in P aris after meeting with Jigaro Kano. He was\\nalso one of the first Europeans to become a black belt in\\nJudo, in 1936.\\nObtaining his Ph.D. at the Sorbonne, he went on to\\nassist Nobel Prize laureate, Frédéric Joliot-Curie at the\\nCurie Institute. During World War II in England, he\\nworked on the new sonar anti-submarine research.\\nPrompted by a recurring leg injury , he applied his\\nknowledge of the martial arts and his training as an engi-\\nneer to devise a method of re-integrating the body . The\\nconcept was that more efficient movement would allow\\nfor the treatment of pain or disability , and the better-\\nfunctioning of the body as a whole.

Feldenkrais can also help injured ath-\\nletes regain lost potential and free them from pain and\\nrestriction of movement.\\nThere are numerous accounts of the remarkable re-\\nsults obtained when Feldenkrais is taught to handicapped\\nchildren so that they can learn to function despite their\\nlimitations. Handicapped people can learn to make full\\nuse of whatever potential they have, and to have more\\nconfidence in their abilities. Practitioners who specialize\\nin teaching Feldenkrais to those who have handicaps\\nhave in many cases allowed the patient to discover ways\\nof performing tasks which were previously thought to be\\nimpossible for them.\\nThe elderly , whose movements are often restricted\\nby pain and stiffness, can learn to overcome these obsta-\\ncles with Feldenkrais instruction. In some instances even\\nsevere cases of arthritis have been conquered. Theoreti-\\ncally , Feldenkrais can make possible renewed levels of\\nenergy and freedom from restriction.\\nDescription\\nFeldenkrais is described a being a dual system, with\\ntwo components: “ A wareness Through Movement” and\\n“Functional Integration. ” The system aims to re-educate\\nthe body so that habitual movements that cause strain or\\npain can be relearned to improve efficiency and elimi-\\nnate dangerous or painful action.\\nFeldenkrais helps to translate intention into action. In\\npractice, an individual can learn to achieve his or her high-\\nest potential, while at the same time learning to avoid and\\neliminate stresses, strains, and the possibility of injury .\\nFunctional integration\\nDuring this session, the patient wears comfortable\\nclothing, and may sit, stand, walk, or lie on a low padded\\ntable. The practitioner helps the pupil by guiding him or\\nher through a number of movements. The practitioner\\nmay use touch to communicate with the student, but\\ntouch is not used to correct any movements. The purpose\\nof this session is to increase a student’s awareness of his\\nor her own movement and become open to different pos-\\nsibilities for movement. The instruction can be focused\\non a particular activity that the student does every day , or\\nthat causes him or her pain. The student can learn to alter\\nhabitual movements and re-educate the neuromuscular\\nsystem. This type of session is particularly useful for\\nthose who suffer from limitations originating from mis-\\nuse, stress, illness, or accident. It can also help athletes\\nand musicians perform to the best of their ability by in-\\ncreasing their possibilities for movement. It offers stu-\\ndents the potential for improving their physical and men-\\ntal performance in addition to heightening the sense of\\nwell-being.\\nAwareness through movement\\nFeldenkrais’s martial arts background can be clearly\\nidentified in many of the aspects of A wareness Through\\nMovement (A TM). During group sessions, pupils are\\ntaught to become acutely aware of all their movements\\nand to imagine them, so that they can improve the effi-\\nciency of their actions in their minds, and put them into\\npractice. Pupils are encouraged to be disciplined about\\npracticing their exercises, to achieve maximum benefit.\\nA wareness through movement is described as an ex-\\nploratory , nonjudgmental process through which pupils\\nare encouraged to observe and learn about themselves\\nand their movements. The range of this therapy is wide,\\nand there are thousands of different lessons designed to\\nhelp specific areas.\\nPreparations\\nNo preparation is necessary for the practice of\\nFeldenkrais, and all are encouraged to seek help from\\nthis system. No condition is considered a preclusion to\\nthe benefits of Feldenkrais.\\nPrecautions\\nAs with any therapy or treatment, care should be\\ntaken to choose a qualified practitioner. Feldenkrais\\npractitioners stress that the body must not be forced to\\ndo anything, and if any movement is painful, or even un-\\ncomfortable, it should be discontinued immediately and\\nthe patient should seek professional help.\\nSide effects\\nNo known side effects are associated with the prac-\\ntice of Feldenkrais.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nSince Moshe Feldenkrais began to teach his method,\\nit has gradually gained acceptance as an education sys-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 739\\nFeldenkrais\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 739'),\n",

The English\\ntranslation of Feng shui is “the way of Wind (feng) and\\nW ater (shui)” or “the natural forces of the universe. ”\\nOrigins\\nFeng shui, derived from the Chinese concept of yin\\nand yang, has been practiced for thousands of years. Evi-\\ndence of the existence of this practice can be found in\\nthe alignment and organization of graves in the Y angshao\\nvillages from 6000 \\nB.C. In fact, there is compelling evi-\\ndence that suggests that feng shui was not strictly an\\nAsian entity . In prehistoric Europe, the practice of ar-\\nranging objects and structures to be in harmony with the\\nuniverse was a relatively common practice.\\nA popular theory regarding the origins of feng shui\\nsuggests that the practice stemmed from ancient shaman\\nwho understood the vital importance of strategically\\nplacing a village. Areas which possessed mild winds\\nwould generate plentiful harvests while harsh winds\\nwould stunt crop growth or destroy the harvest altogeth-\\ner. In addition, the placement of a village in close prox-\\nimity to flowing water and fresh springs would stimulate\\ngrowth and ensure health, while stagnant water would\\nfoster disease and disharmony within the community . As\\nthe centuries passed, these shaman correlated their\\nthoughts on wind and water with the teachings of Dao-\\nism, thus creating the practice of feng shui.\\nBenefits\\nAs a design philosophy , “good” feng shui is be-\\nlieved to promote health, prosperity , creativity , positive\\nsocial relationships, self-confidence, contemplation, and\\nrespect for others.\\nDescription\\nAn ancient Daoist Chinese theory of design and\\nplacement, feng shui grew from observations that an in-\\ndividual’s surroundings elicit positive and negative ef-\\nfects. According to Daoism, everything that exists con-\\ntains qi (chi), the energy or life force. This qi possesses\\ntwo properties, yin (receptive) and yang (active)—they\\nare opposites and cannot exist without the other. Within\\nthe qi, eight constituents compose the universe (the\\nLake, the Mountain, Fire, W ater, Heaven, Thunder,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2740\\nFeng shui\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nNeuromuscular —The body system of nerves and\\nmuscles as they function together .\\nRepetitive strain injury —Injury resulting from a\\nrepeated movement such as typing or throwing a\\nball.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 740'),\n",

Each trigram, or combination of three\\nyin/yang elements, represents a particular quality and\\npattern of energy . In turn, the proper arrangement of\\nthese energetic qualities would affect not only the qi of\\nthe environment, but that of the individual within the en-\\nvironment as well. With feng shui, the goal is to bring\\nboth into harmony so as to foster prosperity , health, and\\nwell-being with the Wind (feng) dispersing the qi\\nthroughout the universe and W ater (shui).\\nThe ba gua, or “Sequence of the Later Heaven, ” is\\nthe arrangement of the energy trigrams so that they exist\\nin harmony and balance. Each trigram has a balancing\\npartner that contributes to universal harmony . For exam-\\nple, Earth is balanced by the Mountain, Fire is balanced\\nby the W ater, Wind is balanced by Heaven, and Thunder is\\nbalanced by Lake. The ba gau is laid in a circular pattern\\nwith Fire at the top, followed by Earth, the Lake, Heaven,\\nW ater, the Mountain, Thunder, and Wind (clockwise). The\\nT aiji (or yin-yang symbol) is located in the center of the\\ntrigrams, and represents the unifying force of the universe.\\nPractitioners of feng shui use the ba gua to determine\\nthe energy flow throughout the home and in other living\\nspaces. By corresponding the trigram pattern to the dif-\\nferent parts of a room, a practitioner determines whether\\nthe room is in harmony with the universe. For example,\\nwhen analyzing a home office or workspace of a writer or\\nartist, a feng shui specialist would pay particular attention\\nto the portion of the room that corresponds to the Lake of\\nthe ba gua, because the Lake represents creative energy .\\nIf there is clutter or disorganization in the section of the\\nroom that corresponds to the Lake, or if the room is parti-\\ntioned so that the Lake section is actually occupied by a\\nbookcase or closet, then the environment would be con-\\nsidered to stifle creativity . A feng shui specialist might\\nrecommend moving the office to a more hospitable room\\nin the house, or reconstructing the storage space to free\\nup the creative energy in the Lake section of the room.\\nGood health is said to be located in the Wind trigram of\\nthe ba gua, so maintaining this space and using it effec-\\ntively is critical to practitioners of feng shui.\\nThere are many other design tenets of feng shui, but\\nsome of the most commonly used and basic concepts in-\\nclude:\\n• Energy , or qi, enters and exits rooms through door-\\nways. Doors facing each other encourage qi to move\\ntoo quickly through and out of the room. Doors on ad-\\njoining walls encourage a circular movement of qi that\\nis considered relaxing and “good” feng shui.\\n• Arranging chairs, beds, chaises, sofas, or other seating\\nwith their backs to the door and/or windows is not recom-\\nmended in feng shui. It is considered “bad” feng shui to\\nleave the back exposed to possible attack through the door.\\n• Homes located at the end of a cul-de-sac, across from a\\nchurch or other spiritual center, at the end of a bridge,\\nor near a freeway are not desirable to feng shui practi-\\ntioners because these locations all have either too fast\\nor not enough energy flow .\\n• When choosing a home site to build on, the ideal location\\naccording to feng shui principles is a rectangular plot of\\nland, on a hill, with open space in front of the home.\\n• The front door of a home should be in proportion to the\\nsize of the house. T oo large or too small an entrance\\nwill not facilitate proper qi flow through the home.\\n• Mirrors used in the home should not face chairs or beds.\\n• Windows should face only pleasing, natural views\\nwhen at all possible. If a view is dreary , the feng shui of\\nthe room can be improved by using window treatments\\ninside and/or window box plantings outside.\\nPrecautions\\nIndividuals should observe basic building code and\\nfire safety rules when redesigning a home according to\\nfeng shui principles.\\nFeng shui adjustments to living space should not be\\nrelied upon as a sole source of treatment for individuals\\nwith health problems. Although feng shui principles can\\nbe employed as an adjunct, or complementary , treatment,\\nproper diagnosis and treatment from a qualified health-\\ncare professional is necessary in treating any chronic or\\nacute physical disorder.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nFeng shui has been practiced throughout Asia for\\nthousands of years, and has recently grown in popularity\\nin the United States as a tool for home design. Although\\nconsidered part of traditional Chinese medicine in\\nAsia, it is not largely regarded as a healthcare tool in the\\nUnited States, preventative or otherwise.\\nT raining & certification\\nCertification and/or licensing is not required to prac-\\ntice feng shui in the United States.

Fen-\\nnel has naturalized in most temperate areas of the world,\\nand is extensively cultivated for medicinal, ornamental,\\nand culinary uses.\\nGeneral use\\nThe seeds, leaves, and roots of fennel are safe and\\nedible. The essential oil, extracted from the seeds, is\\ntoxic even in small amounts. Fennel has been widely\\nused in culinary and medicinal preparations for cen-\\nturies. The herb acts as a carminative, and was tradition-\\nally employed as a digestive aid and remedy for flatu-\\nlence. An infusion or decoction of the dried seeds is anti-\\nspasmodic and will ease stomach pains and speed up the\\ndigestion of fatty foods. Fennel is a proven remedy for\\ncolic in infants, and is safe when administered as a mild\\ninfusion of the leaf and seed. It is also used for coughs\\nand colds. Fennel exerts a calming influence on the\\nbronchial tissues. The seeds contain large amounts of the\\nphytochemical alpha-pinene, which acts as an expecto-\\nrant and helps to loosen phlegm in the lungs. An eye-\\nwash, prepared from a decoction of the crushed seeds, is\\nsaid to improve eyesight and reduce irritation and eye-\\nstrain. Fennel has a long history of use as a galacta-\\ngogue. The seed, when boiled in barley water, acts to in-\\ncrease the flow of breast milk in nursing mothers. A\\npoultice of the herb may be helpful to relieve swelling of\\nthe breasts during lactation. A leaf and seed tea has been\\nused to expel hookworm and kill intestinal bacteria.

The finely divided leaves,\\nwith numerous thread-like segments, grow from a sheath\\nsurrounding the stalk at the base of the leaf stem. The\\ndelicate, blue-green filiform leaf segments have a pun-\\ngent scent, somewhat similar to licorice , and an anise-\\nlike flavor. This characteristic is due to the presence of\\nthe phytochemical anethol, also a primary constituent of\\nanise oil. Fennel’s tiny yellow flowers form in large,\\ncompound umbells. The blossoms are frequently visited\\nby bees, wasps, and other insects, and fennel leaf is a fa-\\nvorite food of the swallowtail-butterfly .\\nThis perennial native of the Mediterranean is called\\nmarathon in Greece, a name derived from the word\\nmaraino, meaning to grow thin. Fennel was recommend-\\ned as an herb for weight reduction, “to make people\\nmore lean that are too fat, ” according to the seventeenth\\ncentury herbalist and astrologer Nicholas Culpeper. He\\nconsidered fennel to be an herb of Mercury , under the\\nsign of V irgo. In Chinese and Hindu cultures fennel was\\ningested to speed the elimination of poisons from the\\nsystem, particularly after snakebite and scorpion stings.\\nAs one of the ancient Saxon people’s nine sacred herbs,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 743\\nFennel\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nDaoism —Also called T aoism, Dao means “the\\nway .” Daoism is a holistic spiritual philosophy of\\nthe universe that is based on the idea that all ele-\\nments in the universe are interactive and interde-\\npendent with each other and that the universe and\\nnatural world are in a constant state of change, or\\nflux.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 743'),\n",

Its botanical name is\\nTrigonella foenum-graecum ; its English name comes\\nfrom two Latin words meaning Greek hay . Fenugreek is\\nan annual plant that grows 2–3 ft (0.6–0.9 m) tall, with a\\nstrong odor and small pale yellow flowers. The seed of\\nthe fenugreek plant contains many active compounds\\nwith pharmaceutical applications. The seeds are collected\\nin the autumn. The chemical components of fenugreek\\nseed include iron, vitamin A , vitamin B\\n1, vitamin C ,\\nphosphates, flavonoids, saponins, trigonelline, and other\\nalkaloids. The seed is also high in fiber and protein.\\nGeneral use\\nQuite apart from its therapeutic value, fenugreek is\\nused as a seasoning and flavoring agent in foods, particu-\\nlarly in Egypt, India, and the Middle East. The maple\\nsmell and flavor of fenugreek have led to its use as a\\nspice in foods, beverages, confections, tobacco, and imi-\\ntation maple syrup. In some countries, the seeds are\\neaten raw or boiled, or the greens are enjoyed as a fresh\\nsalad. Extracts of fenugreek are used in some cosmetic\\nproducts as well.\\nIn addition to its use in flavoring foods, the antifun-\\ngal and antibacterial properties of fenugreek are now\\nbeing applied to food preservation. In June 2002, a high\\nschool student from Maryland was awarded a Lemelson-\\nMIT Invention Apprenticeship for her invention of a\\nfood packaging paper made from fenugreek seeds.\\nThe best-documented medical use of fenugreek is to\\ncontrol blood sugar in both insulin-dependent (type 1)\\nand noninsulin-dependent (type 2) diabetics. Some stud-\\nies also show that serum cholesterol levels in diabetics,\\nand perhaps in others, are reduced by fenugreek. Doses\\nas low as 15 mg per day may produce beneficial effects\\non fasting blood sugar, elevation of blood sugar after a\\nmeal, and overall glycemic control. The use of fenugreek\\nis likely to alter the diabetic patient’s need for insulin or\\nother medications used to control blood sugar. This treat-\\nment should be supervised by a health care provider fa-\\nmiliar with the use of herbal therapies for diabetes. The\\nrecommended doses of fenugreek can vary rather widely .\\nThe seeds of fenugreek can also act as a bulk laxa-\\ntive as a result of their fiber and mucilage content. These\\nportions of the seed swell up from being in contact with\\nwater, filling the bowel and stimulating peristaltic activ-\\nity . For laxative purposes, 0.5–1 tsp of freshly powdered\\nherb per cup of water, followed by an additional 8 oz\\nwater, can be taken one to three times daily . Patients\\nshould begin with the lowest effective dose of fenugreek;\\nthey should also avoid taking oral medications or vita-\\nmins at the same time as the herb.\\nCapsules of fenugreek seed are sometimes recom-\\nmended as a galactogogue, or agent to increase milk pro-\\nduction in the lactating mother. This use of the herb\\nshould be undertaken cautiously , since the evidence of\\nsafety for the nursing infant is only anecdotal. Some\\ncommercial teas promoted for the purpose of increasing\\nlactation use fenugreek as an ingredient, but herbal con-\\ncentration in teas can vary widely and are generally\\nsomewhat low .\\nThere is some evidence that internal use of fenu-\\ngreek seed can decrease some stone-forming substances\\nin the kidney , particularly calcium oxalate. Patients who\\nare prone to this type of kidney stone may wish to con-\\nsult a health care provider about the advisability and\\ndose of fenugreek seed for this use.\\nFenugreek may encourage a flagging appetite, and is\\nsometimes given during convalescence from illnesses to im-\\nprove food intake, weight gain, and speed of recuperation.\\nCancer researchers are also studying fenugreek for\\nits potential effectiveness as a cancer chemopreventive.\\nIt is thought that fenugreek may help to prevent cancer\\nby raising the levels of vitamin C, vitamin E , and other\\nantioxidants in the bloodstream.\\nHistorically , fenugreek has been used as a topical\\ntreatment for abscesses, boils, burns, eczema, gout, and\\nulceration of the skin as it has an anti-inflammatory ef-\\nfect. It is also reputedly useful for a number of digestive\\ncomplaints, including gastritis and gastric ulcers.

For this reason it should not be taken during preg-\\nnancy . As a gargle, fenugreek may relieve sore throats\\nand coughing. Arthritis, bronchitis, fevers, and male re-\\nproductive conditions are other traditional but unsub-\\nstantiated indications for this herb.\\nPreparations\\nFenugreek may be purchased as bulk seeds, capsules,\\ntinctures, or in teas. Due to the strong, bitter taste, cap-\\nsules are used most often. The dose is variable, depend-\\ning on the form of the herb that is used. The seeds may\\nalso be soaked to make a tea. For topical use, powdered\\nfenugreek seed is mixed with water to form a paste.\\nHerbal supplements should be stored in a cool, dry place,\\naway from direct light and out of the reach of children.\\nPrecautions\\nFenugreek may , when taken in larger amounts than\\nare used to season foods, cause contractions of the\\nuterus. For this reason, women who are pregnant should\\navoid therapeutic doses. Frequent topical use of fenu-\\ngreek preparations may cause skin irritation and sensiti-\\nzation. Symptoms of allergic reaction include swelling,\\nnumbness, and wheezing . This herb should not be used\\nby anyone with sensitivity to fenugreek. Large doses\\n(over 100 g per day) may cause intestinal symptoms, in-\\ncluding diarrhea, nausea, and gas. Blood sugar can also\\ndrop to abnormally low levels. Fenugreek is generally\\nrecognized as safe, but its safety is not well-documented\\nfor use in small children, lactating women, or persons\\nwith liver or kidney disease.\\nSide effects\\nDepending on the dose used, fenugreek may cause a\\nmaple syrup odor in the patient’s sweat and urine.\\nInteractions\\nFenugreek can enhance anticoagulant activity , and\\nshould not be used with other herbs or medications (he-\\nparin, warfarin, ticlopidine) that have this effect due to in-\\ncreased risk of bleeding. It can lower blood sugar to a\\nmarked degree; blood sugar levels should be monitored\\nclosely , particularly in people who are taking insulin, glip-\\nizide, or other hypoglycemic agents. Medications that are\\nbeing taken to control diabetes may need to have dosages\\nadjusted, which should be done under medical supervi-\\nsion. In theory , since fenugreek is high in mucilage, it can\\nalter the absorption of any oral medication.

They try to match the remedy to the total-\\nity of the patient’s symptoms, including emotional char-\\nacteristics and personality traits. Thus a classically\\ntrained homeopath would not give ferrum phos. automat-\\nically to every patient who walked into the office com-\\nplaining of fever or a viral illness. A contemporary\\nAmerican practitioner of homeopathy recommends giv-\\ning ferrum phos. when the person does not have clear\\nand distinct symptoms that would point to another reme-\\ndy . The profile of the ferrum phos. person is that he or\\nshe has a lower fever and is more alert than one who\\nneeds belladonna but less upset and fearful than one\\nwho needs aconite. Where a patient with the belladonna\\nprofile may have a face that is flushed all over with fever,\\nthe ferrum phos. patient has clearly defined pink or red\\npatches on the cheeks. The ferrum phos. patient is not fo-\\ncused solely on his or her discomfort and may have con-\\nversations with others as if he or she were not ill.\\nOther characteristics of ferrum phos. patients in-\\nclude a tendency to tire easily . They are nervous, sensi-\\ntive people, disturbed by anxiety-provoking dreams.\\nThey may be restless sleepers, even though their illness-\\nes are often brought on by overexertion. In addition, fer-\\nrum phos. patients often bleed easily; they are more\\nprone to nosebleeds or minor bleeding from the gums at\\nthe onset of an illness. If they cough up mucus, it is like-\\nly to be streaked with blood.\\nThe homeopathic definition of “symptom” is broader\\nthan the standard medical understanding. T o a homeopath,\\nsymptoms represent the body’s attempts to deal with an\\ninternal or external ailment. They are guides to choosing\\nthe correct remedy rather than problems to be suppressed.\\nA homeopathic practitioner who is asking a patient about\\nsymptoms will inquire about the circumstances (e.g., light\\nor dark, heat or cold, rest or activity , etc.) that make the\\npatient feel better or worse. These factors are called\\nmodalities in homeopathy .

It can be purchased from homeo-\\npathic pharmacies or over the internet. Common poten-\\ncies of ferrum phos. are 30C and 6X. The abbreviation\\n30C stands for a centesimal potency . This indicates that a\\nprocess of dilution, along with vigorous shaking (succus-\\nsion) of the remedy , has been repeated 30 times to\\nachieve the desired potency . The abbreviation 6X indi-\\ncates a decimal potency , and means that this decimal dilu-\\ntion has been repeated six times. In homeopathic practice,\\nthe strength of the remedy is in inverse proportion to the\\namount of chemical or plant extract in the alcohol or\\nwater; thus a 30C preparation of ferrum phos. is consid-\\nered a much higher potency than a 6X preparation. Peo-\\nple using homeopathic remedies at home are generally\\nencouraged to use the lower potencies such as 6X or 12X.\\nPrecautions\\nThe precautions recommended by homeopaths re-\\nflect concerns about proper administration of the reme-\\ndies rather than specifying categories of patients who\\nshould not receive a given remedy . The quantity of a\\nhomeopathic remedy , for example, is less critical than\\nthe frequency of dosing. Homeopathy follows the princi-\\nple of minimal dosing, which means in practice that the\\npatient is not given a second dose of a remedy (or a dose\\nof a different remedy) until the first has completed its ac-\\ntion. Minimal dosing is based on the homeopathic belief\\nthat remedies work by stimulating or “jump-starting” the\\nbody’s own natural defenses against illness rather than\\nby killing germs. In general, however, the more severe\\nthe patient’s acute symptoms, the more often he or she\\nwould be given the remedy . A ferrum phos. patient with\\na bad cold might be given a dose of the remedy every\\nthree to six hours, while one with a milder illness might\\nbe given only one or two doses a day .\\nPrecautions regarding homeopathic remedies also\\ninclude avoiding contamination of the medicine. The pa-\\ntient should not touch the medicine; it should be dis-\\npensed into a cup and tipped directly into the patient’s\\nmouth. Homeopathic remedies are not taken with water\\nbut allowed to dissolve in the mouth. Patients are asked\\nnot to eat or drink for about twenty minutes before and\\nafter each dose.\\nSide effects\\nHomeopathic remedies rarely have side effects in\\nthe usual sense of the phrase because they are so dilute.\\nOn the other hand, a homeopathic remedy may some-\\ntimes appear to be making a patient’s symptoms tem-\\nporarily worse as part of the healing process. This tem-\\nporary aggravation of the symptoms would be regarded\\nby homeopaths as an indication that the remedy is effec-\\ntively stimulating the patient’s body to heal itself.\\nInteractions\\nHomeopathic practitioners are not as a rule con-\\ncerned with drug interactions, in part because homeo-\\npathic remedies are so dilute that there is little of the orig-\\ninal substance to interact with a prescription given by an\\nallopathic physician. In addition, the homeopathic “single\\nmedicine” principle, according to which a patient is given\\nonly one homeopathic remedy at a time for a given ill-\\nness, also minimizes potential interactions among differ-\\nent remedies. For example, a ferrum phos. patient would\\nnot be given a different cold or cough remedy unless the\\nhomeopath determined that the patient’s symptoms were\\nchanging and required a remedy with a different symp-\\ntom profile. There is, however, an ongoing debate among\\nhomeopathic practitioners about the legitimacy of combi-\\nnation remedies. Many homeopathic pharmacies sell\\npreparations that are low-potency combinations of the\\nmost commonly used remedies for use at home.

Frey , PhD\\nFever\\nDefinition\\nA fever is a rise in body temperature to greater than\\n100°F (37.8°C).\\nDescription\\nA healthy person’s body temperature fluctuates be-\\ntween 97°F (36.1°C) and 100°F (37.8°C), with the aver-\\nage being 98.6°F (37°C). The body maintains stability\\nwithin this range by balancing the heat produced by the\\nmetabolism with the heat lost to the environment. The\\n“thermostat” that controls this process is located in the\\nhypothalamus, a small structure located deep within the\\nbrain. The nervous system constantly relays information\\nabout the body’s temperature to the thermostat. In turn,\\nthe thermostat activates different physical responses de-\\nsigned to cool or warm the body , depending on the cir-\\ncumstances. These responses include:\\n• decreasing or increasing the flow of blood from the\\nbody’s core, where it is warmed, to the surface, where\\nit is cooled\\n• slowing down or speeding up the rate at which the body\\nturns food into energy (metabolic rate)\\n• inducing shivering, which generates heat through mus-\\ncle contraction\\n• inducing sweating, which cools the body through evap-\\noration\\nA fever occurs when the body’s thermostat resets at a\\nhigher temperature, which primarily happens in response\\nto an infection. T o reach the higher temperature, the body\\nmoves blood to the warmer interior, increases the metabol-\\nic rate, and induces shivering. The chills that often accom-\\npany a fever are caused by the movement of blood to the\\nbody’s core, which leaves the surface and extremities cold.\\nOnce the body reaches the higher temperature, the shiver-\\ning and chills stop. When the infection has been overcome\\nor drugs such as aspirin or acetaminophen (T ylenol) have\\nnear perfumes, bleach, or other strong-smelling sub-\\nstances. In addition, patients under the care of a home-\\nopath are instructed to avoid coffee or products containing\\ncamphor (lip balms, chest rubs, etc.) during a period of\\nhomeopathic treatment and for two days after the last\\ndose. Homeopaths believe that these substances counter-\\nact or “antidote” the effects of homeopathic remedies.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCummings, Stephen, and Dana Ullman.

The blood\\nmoves to the surface and sweating occurs.\\nFever is an important component of the immune re-\\nsponse, though its role is not completely understood. Physi-\\ncians believe that an elevated body temperature has several\\neffects. Certain chemicals in the immune system react with\\nthe fever-inducing agent and trigger the resetting of the\\nthermostat. These immune system chemicals also increase\\nthe production of cells that fight off the invading bacteria or\\nviruses. Higher temperatures also inhibit the growth of\\nsome bacteria and speed up the chemical reactions that help\\nthe body’s cells repair themselves. Changes in blood circu-\\nlation may cause the heart rate to increase, which speeds the\\narrival of white blood cells to the sites of infection.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nFevers are primarily caused by viral or bacterial in-\\nfections , such as pneumonia or influenza . However,\\nother conditions can induce a fever, including these:\\n• allergic reactions\\n• autoimmune diseases\\n• trauma, such as breaking a bone\\n• cancer\\n• excessive exposure to the sun\\n• intense exercise\\n• hormonal imbalances\\n• certain drugs\\n• damage to the hypothalamus\\nWhen an infection occurs, fever-inducing agents\\ncalled pyrogens are released, either by the body’s im-\\nmune system or by the invading cells themselves. These\\npyrogens trigger the resetting of the thermostat. In other\\ncircumstances, an uncontrolled release of pyrogens may\\noccur when the immune system overreacts due to an al-\\nlergic reaction or becomes damaged due to an autoim-\\nmune disease. A stroke or tumor can damage the hypo-\\nthalamus, causing the body’s thermostat to malfunction.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 750'),\n",

Malignant hyper-\\nthermia is a rare, inherited condition in which a person\\ndevelops a very high fever when given certain anesthet-\\nics or muscle relaxants in preparation for surgery .\\nA recent study showed that most parents have mis-\\nconceptions about fever and view it as a disease rather\\nthan a symptom. How long a fever lasts and how high it\\nmay go depend on several factors, including its cause\\nand the patient’s age and overall health. Most fevers\\ncaused by infections are acute, appearing suddenly and\\nthen dissipating as the immune system defeats the infec-\\ntious agent. An infectious fever may also rise and fall\\nthroughout the day , reaching its peak in the late after-\\nnoon or early evening. A low-grade fever that lasts for\\nseveral weeks is associated with autoimmune diseases\\nsuch as lupus or with some cancers, particularly\\nleukemia and lymphoma.\\nDiagnosis\\nA fever is usually diagnosed using a thermometer. A\\nvariety of different thermometers are available, including\\ntraditional oral and rectal thermometers made of glass and\\nmercury , and more sophisticated electronic ones that can\\nbe inserted in the ear. For adults and older children, tem-\\nperature readings are usually taken orally . Y ounger children\\nwho cannot or will not hold a thermometer in their mouths\\ncan have their temperatures taken by placing an oral ther-\\nmometer under their armpits. Infants generally have their\\ntemperature taken rectally using a rectal thermometer.\\nAs important as registering a patient’s temperature\\nis determining the underlying cause of the fever. The\\nphysician can make a diagnosis by checking for accom-\\npanying symptoms and by reviewing the patient’s med-\\nical history , any recent trips he or she has taken, what he\\nor she may have ingested, or any illnesses he or she has\\nbeen exposed to. Blood tests hold additional clues. Anti-\\nbodies in the blood point to the presence of an infectious\\nagent, which can be verified by growing the organism in\\na culture. Blood tests can also provide the doctor with\\nwhite blood cell counts. Ultrasound tests, magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI) tests, or computed tomography\\n(CT) scans may be ordered if the doctor cannot readily\\ndetermine the cause of a fever.\\nT reatment\\nOften, doctors must remind patients, especially par-\\nents, not to “overtreat” low fevers but to remember that\\nthey are symptoms of an underlying disease or condition.\\nAlternative therapies for treatment of fever focus not\\nonly on reducing fever but also on boosting the immune\\nfunction to help the body fight infections more effective-\\nly . They include nutritional therapy , herbal therapy and\\ntraditional Chinese medicine.\\nNutritional therapy\\nNaturopaths often recommend that patients take\\nhigh doses of vitamin C to ward off diseases and prevent\\nfever. In addition to vitamin C, other antioxidants such\\nas vitamin A and zinc also boost the immune function.\\nNaturopaths may also suggest reducing sugar intake\\n(even fruit juices) because sugar depresses the immune\\nsystem. T o replace fluid that is lost during fever, patients\\nare advised to drink vegetable juices and eat soups.\\nHerbal therapy\\nW estern herbalists use tea preparations containing\\nherbs such as bupleurum root or boneset to reduce fever.\\nMild herbs such as peppermint, elderflower, or yarrow\\ncan provide comfort to the child who has a mild fever.\\nOthers believe in sweating a fever out, literally . They\\noften recommend that patients take hot baths to induce\\nsweating. This helps induce or increase fever, which is\\nbelieved to help the body get rid of infections.\\nChinese medicine (TCM) offers many herbs and\\nformulas for fevers. There are many distinct kinds of\\nfevers, also called heat syndromes. For example, an ex-\\ncess-heat syndrome is characterized by a high fever,\\ngreat thirst, and lots of sweating. Deficiency heat syn-\\ndrome is characterized by a low-grade fever with after-\\nnoon fevers or night sweats. For excess heat, herbs that\\nare dispersing and cold in nature are used. For chronic\\nand low-grade fevers, herbs that tonify the yin (cooling\\naspect) are used as well as herbs that get rid of heat.\\nThere are even herbs such as bupleurum root (called\\nChai Hu in TCM) that are used for intermittent fevers or\\nconditions alternating between fever and chills. Alternat-\\ning fevers and chills occur in malaria , conditions con-\\nnected to AIDS , chronic fatigue syndrome , and Ep-\\nstein-Barr virus. The individual pattern should be diag-\\nnosed by a trained practitioner.\\nAromatherapy\\nPatients can reduce feverish symptoms by inhaling\\nessential oils of camphor, eucalyptus , lemon, and hys-\\nsop. These oils can also be mixed with an unscented body\\nlotion or a vegetable oil for aromatherapy massage.\\nHomeopathy\\nHomeopathic doctors may prescribe herbal reme-\\ndies based on the patient’s overall personality profile as\\nwell as specific symptoms.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 751\\nFever\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 751'),\n",

This European\\nnative of the Compositae (Asteraceae) or aster family\\nhas naturalized throughout North and South America, es-\\ncaping from cultivation. It can be found along roadsides\\nand along the borders of wooded areas. Other common\\nnames include featherfew , febrifuge plant, featherfoil,\\nmid-summer daisy , and wild chamomile.\\nFeverfew is a bushy and herbaceous perennial that\\ngrows from a branched and tapering root to produce\\nerect, round and slightly grooved stems. The feathery ,\\naromatic and bitter-tasting leaves are arranged alternate-\\nly along the length of the many-branched stem. They are\\na yellow-green, stalked, and bipinnate with deeply cut,\\ntoothed segments in an oval shape. Flowers bloom in\\nmid to late-summer in flat-topped clusters at the end of\\nstems that may reach to a height of three feet. Smaller\\nthan daisies, and without the protruding central disk of\\nchamomile, feverfew blossoms have yellow centers con-\\nsisting of tightly-bunched tubular florets surrounded by\\ncreamy white rays. Bees seem to avoid feverfew , de-\\nterred by its pungent aroma. The plant self-seeds freely ,\\nand thrives in full sun or partial shade in most soil.\\nGeneral use\\nFeverfew leaves and flowers are used medicinally .\\nAmong its many uses, the herb has become a popular\\nand proven herbal remedy for the treatment of migraine\\nheadaches. This important use of the plant was recorded\\nas far back as 1633 by the British herbalist Gerard. With\\nfrequent use, over time, feverfew can reduce the frequen-\\ncy , severity , and duration of migraine headaches and\\nallay nausea and vomiting . It is most effective when\\nused as a preventive. It acts to inhibit serotonin and hist-\\namine, substances that dilate blood vessels, and helps to\\nprevent the spasms in blood vessels that trigger migraine\\nheadaches. This much-researched herb has been shown\\nto inhibit production of leukotines and other inflammato-\\nry substances. It is an effective remedy for relieving the\\npain and inflammation of arthritis and alleviating hay\\nfever, asthma and other allergy symptoms.\\nOther traditional uses of feverfew dating back to an-\\ncient Greece and Rome include its use as an emmena-\\ngogue, which is an infusion taken in cases of sluggish\\nmenstruation to relieve congestion and promote period-\\nic flow . The herb has also been used after childbirth to\\nhelp expel the placenta.\\nFeverfew was valued in past centuries for its be-\\nlieved protection against the plague and the bite of mad\\ndogs. In the seventeenth century the herbalist John\\nParkinson recommended feverfew as a remedy to speed\\nrecovery from opium overdose. It has also been used in\\ntreating alcoholic delirium tremens, and to expel intesti-\\nnal worms . The English physician Culpeper recom-\\nmended an external application of the fresh herb to treat\\nague, as the disease malaria was once called. Feverfew\\nis a bitter digestive and liver tonic. A hot infusion may\\nreduce fever and congestion from colds. The infusion,\\ntaken cold, has tonic properties. Feverfew may relieve\\nmild depression , promote restful sleep, and ease the\\nnerve pain of sciatica and shingles. Externally the strong\\ninfusion is an antiseptic skin wash for treatment of insect\\nstings and bites. The wash may also be used as an insect\\nrepellent. Feverfew leaves and stems, gathered fresh,\\nmay be used as a dye plant, with a chrome mordant, to\\nproduce a light green-yellow color in natural fibres such\\nas wool. Feverfew flowers have a purgative action if in-\\ngested, and if the blossom heads are carried into areas\\nwhere bees are located, the insects will fly away .\\nThe active compounds in feverfew include\\nsesquiterpene lactones, predominantly parthenolide.\\nOther phytochemicals include pyrethrin, volatile oils,\\ntannins, bitter resin, and flavonoids.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 753'),\n",

Leaves are removed from the stalks and dried on\\npaper-lined trays in a light, airy room, away from direct\\nsunlight. The dried herb should be stored in clearly-la-\\nbeled, tightly-sealed, dark glass containers.\\nCapsules: Feverfew leaf in capsule form, at a 250\\nmg daily dose, is recommended for medicinal use. It\\nmay take four to six weeks before the herb provides no-\\nticeable relief. Studies of some commercially-prepared\\ncapsules revealed that many did not contain a sufficient\\nquantity of the active ingredient to be medicinally effec-\\ntive. Feverfew may be more medicinally potent when\\ngathered fresh. Three to four fresh leaves, taken daily\\nover a period of time are medicinally effective. A certi-\\nfied practitioner can help determine the most effective\\nand safest levels for individual cases.\\nSyrup: Fresh feverfew leaf can be added to honey , or\\nto a simple sugar syrup. The honey will act as a preserva-\\ntive and mask the bitter taste of the herb.\\nInfusion: T wo to three teaspoons of chopped, fresh\\nfeverfew leaves are placed in a warmed container. One\\ncup of fresh, nonchlorinated boiled water is added to the\\nherbs and the mixture is covered. The tea is infused for\\nabout 15 minutes, then strained. A stronger infusion,\\nusing double the amount of leaf and steeping twice as\\nlong, is useful as a skin wash for repelling insects, or\\nsoothing inflammations and wounds.

The alcohol should be\\nenough to cover the plant parts. Place the mixture away\\nfrom light for about two weeks, shaking several times\\neach day . Strain and store in a tightly capped, dark glass\\nbottle. A standard dose is 30 drops of the tincture three\\ntimes a day .\\nPrecautions\\nSince herbal preparations are not regulated by the\\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA), consumers in the\\nUnited States should check the labels of commercial\\nproducts carefully for dosage instructions and the part(s)\\nof the plant used for or contained in the product. A 2002\\nstudy of commercial feverfew preparations found wide\\nvariations in the recommended dosages and parthenolide\\ncontents of the products that were tested. The researchers\\nfound that “.. intake of parthenolide would range from\\n0.06 to 9.7 mg/day , a 160-fold variation. ” Any adverse\\neffects from feverfew preparations or any other herbal\\nproducts sold as dietary supplements should be reported\\nto the FDA ’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutri-\\ntion, listed under Resources.\\nFeverfew should not be used by pregnant or lactating\\nwomen. Children under two years of age should not be\\ngiven feverfew . Chewing the fresh leaves may irritate the\\nmucous membranes in the mouth causing mouth ulcers in\\nsome persons. Traditionally the fresh herb was enclosed\\nbetween slices of bread to minimize the irritation and\\nmask the bitter taste of the fresh leaves. Persons on pre-\\nscribed blood-thinning drugs should not ingest feverfew\\nas it might interfere with the rate of blood clotting.\\nSide effects\\nFeverfew is a safe herb of proven medicinal value.\\nNo side effects are reported when taken in designated\\ntherapeutic doses.

The term is also\\nused diagnostically to describe the appearance of breast\\ntissues viewed under the microscope, on x-ray film, or\\non ultrasound equipment.\\nDescription\\nThere is no such thing as a typical or normal female\\nbreast. Breasts come in all shapes and sizes, with varying\\ntextures from smooth to extremely lumpy . The tissues of\\nthe female breast change in response to hormone levels,\\nnormal aging, nursing (lactation), weight shifts, and in-\\njury . T o further complicate matters, the breast has several\\ntypes of tissue, each of which may respond differently to\\nchanges in body chemistry .\\nFibrocystic breast disease is clearly not a single,\\nspecific disease process. V ariations or changes in the\\nway the breast feels or looks on an x ray may cause the\\ncondition to be called “fibrocystic change. ” Other names\\nhave been used to refer to this imprecise and ill-defined\\nterm: mammary dysplasia, mastopathy , chronic cystic\\nmastitis, indurative mastopathy , mastalgia, lumpy\\nbreasts, or physiologic nodularity .\\nEstimates vary , but 40–90% of all women have\\nsome evidence of fibrocystic condition, change, or dis-\\nease. It is most common among women ages 30–50, but\\nmay be seen at other ages.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nFibrocystic condition refers to technical findings.\\nThis discussion will focus on symptoms a woman expe-\\nW eiss, Gaea and Shandor.

Some hormone\\nreplacement therapies used for post-menopausal women\\ncan produce these effects. Other medications, primarily ,\\nbut not exclusively , those with hormones, may also pro-\\nvoke these symptoms.\\nBreast pain unrelated to hormone shifts is called\\n“noncyclic” pain. This area-specific pain is also called\\n“trigger-zone breast pain, ” and it may be continuous, or\\nmay be felt intermittently . Trauma, such as a blow to the\\narea, or a breast biopsy performed several years before,\\nor sensitivity to certain medications may also underlie\\nthis type of pain. Fibrocystic condition may be cited as\\nthe cause of otherwise unexplained breast pain.\\nLumps, apart from those clearly associated with\\nhormone cycles, may also be placed under the heading\\nof fibrocystic condition. These lumps stand out from en-\\nlarged general breast tissue. The obvious concern with\\nsuch lumps is cancer, although noncancerous lumps also\\noccur. T wo noncancerous types, fibroadenomas and\\ncysts, are discussed here.\\nFibroadenomas are tumors which form in the tissues\\noutside the milk ducts. The cause of fibroadenomas is\\nunknown. They generally feel smooth and firm, with a\\nsomewhat rubber-like texture. T ypically a fibroadenoma\\nis not attached to surrounding tissue, and will move\\nslightly when touched. They are most commonly found\\nin adolescents and women in their early 20s but can arise\\nat any age.\\nCysts are fluid-filled sacs in the breast. They proba-\\nbly develop as ducts become clogged with old cells in\\nthe process of normal emptying and filling. Cysts usually\\nfeel soft and round or oval. However, a cyst deep within\\nthe breast may feel hard, as it pushes up against firmer\\nbreast tissue. A woman with a cyst may experience pain,\\nespecially if it increases in size before her menstrual\\ncycle, as many do. W omen age 30–50 are most likely to\\ndevelop cysts.\\nSometimes one area of breast tissue persistently\\nfeels thicker or more prominent than the rest of the\\nbreast. This may be caused by hardened scar tissue\\nand/or dead fat tissue from surgery or trauma. Often the\\ncause of such tissue is unknown.\\nA number of other breast problems which are be-\\nnign or noncancerous may be placed under the heading\\nof fibrocystic condition. These include disorders which\\nmay lead to breast inflammation (mastitis), infection,\\nnipple discharge, dilated milk ducts, milk-filled cyst,\\nriences, which may fall under the general category of the\\nfibrocystic condition.\\nThe breast is not a soft, smooth, pulpy organ. It is\\nactually a type of sweat gland. Milk, the breasts’ version\\nof sweat, is secreted when the breast receives appropriate\\nhormonal and environmental stimulation.\\nThe normal breast contains milk glands, with their\\naccompanying ducts, or pipelines, for transporting the\\nmilk. These complex structures may not only alter in size,\\nbut can increase or decrease in number as needed. Fibrous\\nconnective tissue, fatty tissue, nerves, blood and lymph\\nvessels, and lymph nodes, with their different shapes and\\ntextures, lie among the ever-changing milk glands. This\\nexplains why a woman’s breasts may not feel uniform in\\ntexture, and why “lumpiness” may wax and wane.\\nFibrocystic condition is the tenderness, enlargement,\\nand/or changing lumpiness that many women encounter\\njust before or during their menstrual periods. At this\\ntime, female hormones are preparing the breasts for\\npregnancy, by stimulating the milk-producing cells and\\nstoring fluid. Each breast may contain as much as three\\nto six teaspoons of excess liquid. Swelling, with in-\\ncreased sensitivity or pain, may result. If pregnancy does\\nnot occur, the body reabsorbs the fluid, and the engorge-\\nment and discomfort are relieved.\\nThese symptoms range from mildly annoying in\\nsome women to extremely painful in others. The severity\\nof the sensations may vary from month to month in the\\nsame woman. Although sometimes distressing, this ex-\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 756'),\n",

A newly discovered breast lump\\nshould be brought to the attention of a family physician\\nor an obstetrician-gynecologist. A physical examination\\nof the area is usually performed. Depending on the find-\\nings, the patient may be referred for tests.\\nThe most common tests are mammography and breast\\nultrasound. A cyst may be definitively diagnosed by ultra-\\nsound. T o relieve the discomfort, the patient may choose to\\nhave the cyst suctioned, or drained. If there is any question\\nas to the fluid diagnosis, the fluid is sent for analysis.\\nIf a lump cannot be proven benign by mammogra-\\nphy and ultrasound, a breast biopsy may be considered.\\nTissue is removed through a needle to obtain a sample of\\nthe lump. The sample is examined under the microscope\\nby a pathologist, and a detailed diagnosis regarding the\\ntype of benign lesion or cancer is established.\\nA ductogram evaluates nipple discharge. A very fine\\ntube is threaded into the duct, dye is injected, and the\\narea is looked at for diagnosis. Other breast conditions\\nsuch as inflammation or infection are usually recognized\\non the basis of suspicious history , such as breast-feeding\\nand characteristic symptoms such as pain, redness, and\\nswelling. A positive response to appropriate therapies\\nwill support the diagnosis.\\nT reatment\\nW arm soaks, heating pads, or ice packs may provide\\ncomfort. A well-fitted support bra worn day and night\\ncan minimize physical movement and do much to relieve\\nbreast discomfort. Breast massage may promote removal\\nof excess fluid from tissues and alleviate symptoms.\\nMassaging the breast with castor oil , straight or infused\\nwith herbs or diluted essential oils , can help reduce and\\ndissipate fibroadenomas as well as keep women in touch\\nwith changes in their breasts.\\nMany women have reported relief of symptoms\\nwhen caffeine was reduced or eliminated from their\\ndiets. Decreasing salt intake before and during the peri-\\nod when breasts are most sensitive may also ease\\nswelling and discomfort. V itamins A, B complex, and E\\nand selenium supplements have been reported to be\\nhelpful. Because fat promotes estrogen production, and\\nestrogen is thought to be linked to breast tenderness,\\nlow-fat diets and elimination of dairy products also seem\\nto decrease soreness for some women. Restricting salt\\nintake may also help reduce fluid retention and lessen\\nbreast pain. It may take several months to realize the ef-\\nfects of these various treatments.\\nEvening primrose oil (Oenothera biennis), flax oil,\\nand fish oils have been reported to be effective in reliev-\\ning cyclic breast pain for some women. In addition, a\\nfocus on liver cleansing is important to assist the body in\\nconjugation and elimination of excess estrogens. The\\nherb chaste tree ( V itex angus-castus) can be used to help\\nrelieve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS),\\nincluding breast tenderness.\\nA Chinese herbalist may recommend Herba cum\\nRadice Asari with Radix Angelicae Sinensis and Flos\\nCarthami Tinctorii for painful breast lumps, or Rhizoma\\nCyperi Rotundi with Radix Bupleuri and Fructus Tri-\\nchosanthis for breast masses that swell around the time\\nof menstruation.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nA lump that has been proven benign can be left in\\nthe breast. Some women may choose to have a lump\\nsuch as a fibroadenoma surgically removed, especially if\\nit is large. Infections are treated with warm compresses\\nand antibiotics. Lactating women are encouraged to con-\\ntinue breastfeeding, as it promotes drainage and healing.\\nA serious infection may progress to form an abscess\\nwhich may need surgical drainage.\\nOnce a specific disorder within the broad category\\nof fibrocystic condition is identified, treatment can be\\nprescribed. Symptoms of cyclical breast sensitivity and\\nengorgement may be treated with diet, medication,\\nand/or physical modifications.\\nOver-the-counter analgesics (pain relievers) such as\\nacetaminophen (T ylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) may be\\nrecommended. In some cases, treatment with hormones\\nor hormone blockers may prove successful. Birth control\\npills may be prescribed.\\nExpected results\\nMost benign breast conditions carry no increased\\nrisk for the development of breast cancer. However, a\\nsmall percentage of biopsies will uncover overgrowth of\\ntissue in a particular pattern in some women that indi-\\ncates a 15–20% risk of developing breast cancer over the\\nnext 20 years.

Widespread mus-\\ncle pain, fatigue, and multiple tender points characterize\\nthese conditions. Many individuals with fibromyalgia\\ndescribe the symptoms as similar to the aches and pains\\nof a severe case of the flu. Fibrositis, fibromyalgia, and\\nfibromyositis are names given to a set of symptoms be-\\nlieved to be caused by the same general problem.\\nDescription\\nFibromyalgia is more common than previously\\nthought, with as many as 3-6% of the population affected\\nby the disorder. Fibromyalgia is more prevalent in adults\\nthan children, with more women affected than men, par-\\nticularly women of childbearing age.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe exact cause of fibromyalgia is not known. Some-\\ntimes it occurs in several members of a family , suggesting\\nthat it may be an inherited disorder. People with fi-\\nbromyalgia are most likely to complain of three primary\\nsymptoms: muscle and joint pain, stiffness, and fatigue.\\nPain is the major symptom with aches, tenderness,\\nand stiffness of multiple muscles, joints, and soft tissues.\\nThe pain also tends to move from one part of the body to\\nanother. It is most common in the neck, shoulders, chest,\\narms, legs, hips, and back. Although the pain is present\\nmost of the time and may last for years, the severity of\\nthe pain may fluctuate.\\nSymptoms of fatigue may result from the individ-\\nual’s chronic pain coupled with anxiety about the prob-\\nlem and how to find relief. The inflammatory process\\nalso produces chemicals that are known to cause fatigue.\\nOther common symptoms are tension headaches, diffi-\\nculty swallowing, recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea ,\\nand numbness or tingling of the extremities. Stress, anx-\\niety ,depression, or lack of sleep can increase symptoms.\\nIntensity of symptoms is variable ranging from gradual\\nimprovement to episodes of recurrent symptoms.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is difficult and frequently missed because\\nsymptoms of fibromyalgia are vague and generalized.\\nCoexisting nerve and muscle disorders such as rheuma-\\ntoid arthritis, spinal arthritis, or Lyme disease may fur-\\nther complicate the diagnostic process. Presently , there\\nare no tests available to specifically diagnose fibromyal-\\ngia. The diagnosis is usually made after ruling out other\\nmedical conditions with similar symptoms.\\nBecause of the emotional distress experienced by\\npeople with this condition and the influence of stress on\\nthe symptoms themselves, fibromyalgia has often been\\nlabeled a psychological problem. Recognition of the un-\\nderlying inflammatory process involved in fibromyalgia\\nhas helped promote the validity of this disease.\\nThe American College of Rheumatology has devel-\\noped standards for fibromyalgia that health care practi-\\ntioners can use to diagnose this condition. According to\\nthese standards, a person is thought to have fibromyalgia\\nif he or she has widespread pain in combination with\\ntenderness in at least 11 of the 18 sites known as trigger\\npoints. Trigger point sites include the base of the neck,\\nalong the backbone, in front of the hip and elbow , and at\\nthe rear of the knee and shoulder.\\nT reatment\\nThere is no known cure for fibromyalgia.

They have recently ac-\\nquired a new visibility as dietary supplements because\\nthey are high in omega-3 fatty acids . Omega-3 fatty\\nacids, together with the omega-6 fatty acids , are impor-\\ntant components of a healthful diet. The body cannot\\nmanufacture them, therefore they must be obtained from\\ngrains, fruits, vegetable oils, and other foods. In addition,\\npeople should consume a balanced ratio of omega-6 and\\nomega-3 fatty acids. Some researchers believe that these\\ntwo types of fatty acids should be consumed in a 1:1\\nratio, while others maintain that people should obtain\\nseveral times more omega-3 than omega-6 fatty acids\\nfrom their diet. In either case, the fact that fish oils are\\nhigh in omega-3 fatty acids may help people to maintain\\na good balance between the two types of fatty acids. The\\nmost important types of omega-3 fatty acids found in\\nfish oils are eicosapentanoic acid (EP A) and docosa-\\nhexaenoic acid (DHA). The body needs EP A to produce\\nprostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that\\nhelp to protect the heart and the cell membranes. DHA is\\nrequired for the normal development of the brain, the\\neyes, and the reproductive system.\\nGeneral use\\nIn general, fish oils are recommended as dietary\\nsupplements to lower the levels of triglycerides in the\\nblood, counteract inflammation in various parts of the\\nbody , and thin the blood.\\nHeart disease and stroke\\nThe omega-3 fatty acids in fish oils increase the\\nconcentrations of good cholesterol (high density\\nlipoproteins, HDL) in the blood while decreasing the\\nconcentrations of bad cholesterol (triglycerides). They\\nalso lower the total cholesterol level. Furthermore, these\\nomega-3 oils protect the heart by preventing the forma-\\ntion of blood clots and fatty deposits (plaque) on the ar-\\nterial walls. In people with coronary heart disease , fish\\noils may help to reduce the risk of blood clots in the\\nbrain or in the lungs; pain associated with angina ; and\\nthe risk of cardiac arrythmias.\\nThe benefits of omega-3 fatty acids have been\\nshown in clinical studies. Investigation of the possible\\nbenefits of fish oils began when researchers discovered\\nthat Eskimos rarely suffer from heart attacks or rheuma-\\ntoid arthritis (RA) even though their diet is high in fat\\nfrom fish, seals, and whales. Because these sources of fat\\nhave a high omega-3 fatty acid content, it was assumed\\nthat the type of fatty acid that they contained helped to\\nprotect the Eskimos from the usual consequences of\\nhigh-fat diets. Later studies confirmed that diets high in\\nomega-3 fatty acids decrease the risk of heart attacks,\\nstrokes, and abnormal heart rhythms. In one study of\\n20,551 doctors, those who ate at least one fish meal per\\nweek cut their risk of heart attacks in half compared to\\nthose who ate fish once a month or less. In the five-year\\nLyon study , men who followed a Mediterranean diet\\nwith emphasis on omega-3-rich oils, fish, fruits, and veg-\\netables had their heart attack rates reduced by 70%\\ncompared to subjects in the control group. One question,\\nhowever, is whether fish oil used by itself as a dietary\\nsupplement is as effective as a diet high in fish, since the\\ntwo are not the same. One open trial of 11,324 people\\nwho were followed for three to five years found that fish\\noil did reduce the risk of death from heart attack. This\\nstudy , however, was not a double-blind study , and its re-\\nsults cannot be taken as conclusive.\\nHigh blood pressure\\nFish oils may help to control high blood pressure.\\nSeveral studies have shown that taking fish oil can lower\\nblood pressure. On the other hand, a 1997 study involv-\\ning 2,000 subjects found no significant effect.\\nRheumatoid arthritis\\nFish oil may be useful in managing the symptoms of\\nearly rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A significant reduction in\\njoint tenderness, morning stiffness, and fatigue, coupled\\nwith an increase in grip strength, has been observed in pa-\\ntients taking fish oil capsules. Fish oil appears to reduce\\nthe symptoms of RA without side effects, and to increase\\nthe effectiveness of standard medications for it.

With respect to the Raynaud’s patients,\\nsmall double-blind studies showed that very high doses\\nof fish oil reduce their responses to cold. It appears,\\nhowever, that doses as high as 12 g of fish oil daily are\\nnecessary to provide this effect. With respect to lupus, a\\nsmall study of 30 subjects found that 14 out of 17 pa-\\ntients given daily doses of 20 g of EP A derived from fish\\noil had significant improvement.

A number of different substances that\\nare high in fatty acids, including flaxseed oil and GLA\\nas well as fish oil, have been recommended for painful\\nmenstrual periods. One four-month study of adolescents\\nsuggests that fish oil is useful in treating this condition.\\nForty-two young women were divided into two groups;\\nhalf received a daily dose of 6 g of fish oil for two\\nmonths, followed by two months of placebo. The other\\nhalf received the placebo and fish oil in reverse order.\\nThe results indicated that the subjects had significantly\\nless menstrual pain while taking the fish oil.\\nBipolar disorder and depression\\nFish oil does appear to offer considerable benefits to\\npeople with bipolar disorder. A four-month double-blind\\nstudy of 30 subjects indicated that fish oil improves emo-\\ntional stability and helps to prevent relapses. Of the 14 per-\\nsons who took fish oil, 11 stayed well or improved, while\\nonly six out of 16 subjects given placebos stayed well. A\\n2001 report looked at the effects of fish oil on mood and\\ndepression. T wo large studies showed a strong connection\\nbetween rates of depression and bipolar disorder in coun-\\ntries with high amounts of fish in diets. Although re-\\nsearchers cannot say that fish oil is the only reason for the\\ndifference, evidence continues to mount that omega-3 and\\nomega-6 fatty acids may work as mood stabilizers.\\nOther conditions\\nFish oil has been touted as a useful treatment for\\ndiabetic neuropathy , allergies , migraine headaches,\\nCrohn’s disease , gout , and ulcerative colitis, but\\nthere has been little systematic research involving\\nthese applications. In addition, health food manufac-\\nturers list hair loss , memory problems, muscle\\nstrain, failing eyesight, liver complaints, rickets, and\\ndental problems as ailments that can be treated with\\nfish oil. No clinical studies have been cited in sup-\\nport of these claims.\\nEarly studies in laboratories indicate that fish oils\\nmight prolong life in people with automimmune disor-\\nders like diabetes. Early results show that a diet high in\\nfish oils helped improve immune system function in\\nthese patients.\\nPreparations\\nThere is no minimum daily requirement of fish oil\\nas such, but a healthy diet should supply at least 5 g of\\nessential fatty acids every day . T ypical doses of fish oil\\nare 3–9 g daily , although some participants in research\\nstudies have taken much higher doses. If fish oil is taken\\nas a dietary supplement, it should be taken in large\\nenough doses to supply about 1.8 g of EP A and 0.9 g of\\nDHA on a daily basis. Fish oil capsules are available in\\nhealth food stores as over-the-counter items; prices range\\nfrom $7 for 180 capsules of Norwegian cod liver oil to\\n$14 for 180 capsules of salmon oil. Capsules of tuna oil\\nand halibut liver oil are also available from several com-\\nmercial suppliers.\\nPrecautions\\nFish oil can easily become rancid. The capsules can\\nbe stored in the refrigerator to slow the rate of oxidation.\\nAnother option is to purchase capsules that have added\\nvitamin E.\\nThe type of fish oil may make a difference. Al-\\nthough cod liver oil is the easiest form to obtain, it can\\ncause a buildup of vitamin A and vitamin D in the\\nbody because these two vitamins are fat-soluble. Preg-\\nnant women should not take more than 2,500 IU of vit-\\namin A per day because higher amounts can cause birth\\ndefects. Other adults should not consume more than\\n5,000 IU of vitamin A per day . V itamin D can produce\\ntoxicity when taken at levels above 1,000 IU daily for\\nlong periods of time. Persons who obtain their fish oil\\nfrom cod liver oil should check the label to see how\\nmuch vitamin A and vitamin D it contains. It may be\\nprudent to take salmon oil, mackerel oil, or oil from\\nother coldwater fish.\\nW omen who are pregnant or breast-feeding should\\ntalk to their physicians before taking fish oil supple-\\nments or any other medications.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 761\\nFish oil\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 761'),\n",

Odle\\n5-HTP\\nDescription\\nThe acronym for 5-hydroxytryptophan (or 5-hy-\\ndroxy-L-tryptophan) is 5-HTP , a compound found primar-\\nily in the brain. This compound is made from tryptophan,\\na natural amino acid inherent in foods. Tryptophan is an\\nessential amino acid, which means that it cannot be made\\nby the body . It must be obtained from food, particularly\\nproteins. In the liver and brain, 5-HTP is converted to an\\nimportant monoamine neurotransmitter called serotonin.\\nNeurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit\\nsignals between neurons (nerve cells) in the brain.\\nT aking 5-HTP increases the body’s supply of the\\ncompound, which leads to higher serotonin levels in the\\nbrain. Serotonin, also called 5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-\\nHT , plays an important role in controlling behavior and\\nmoods. It influences many normal brain activities and\\nalso regulates the activity of other neurotransmitters.\\nHaving adequate levels of serotonin instills a feeling of\\nrelaxation, calmness, and mild euphoria (extreme happi-\\nness). Low levels of serotonin, serotonin deficiency syn-\\ndrome, leads to depression, anxiety, irritability ,insom-\\nnia, and many other problems.\\nConditions associated with low levels of serotonin\\ninclude:\\n• anxiety\\n• attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\\n• bulimia\\n• depression\\n• epilepsy\\n• fibromyalgia\\n• headaches\\n• hyperactivity\\n• insomnia\\n• obesity\\n• obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)\\n• panic attacks\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2762\\n5-HTP KEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nEssential fatty acid (EFA) —A fatty acid that the\\nbody cannot make but must obtain from the diet.\\nEFAs include omega-6 fatty acids found in prim-\\nrose and safflower oils, and omega-3 fatty acids\\noils found in fatty fish and flaxseed, canola, soy-\\nbean, and walnuts.\\nProstaglandins —Hormone-like substances that\\nthe body produces from essential fatty acids.\\nProstaglandins control the contraction of smooth\\nmuscle, body temperature, and many other\\nprocesses.\\nRaynaud’ s disease—A vascular disorder in which\\nthe patient’ s fingers ache and tingle after exposure\\nto cold or emotional stress, with characteristic\\ncolor changes from white to blue to red.

It is\\nan antioxidant that protects the body from damage by\\nsubstances called free radicals (unstable, toxic mole-\\ncules). In this role, 5-HTP may help slow the aging\\nprocess and protect the body from illness. Because\\nserotonin is used to make melatonin , taking 5-HTP\\nmay help achieve some of the same benefits as mela-\\ntonin, such as treating jet lag , depression, and insom-\\nnia. There is some evidence that 5-HTP can replenish\\nthe supply of the pain-relieving molecules called endor-\\nphins. Studies have shown that low levels of endorphins\\nare associated with chronic fatigue syndrome ,f i -\\nbromyalgia, stress , and depression. In addition, 5-HTP\\naffects other neurotransmitters, including norepineph-\\nrine and dopamine.\\nGeneral use\\nIn studies, 5-HTP has been proven effective in the\\ntreatment of carbohydrate cravings and binge eating,\\nchronic headaches, depression, fibromyalgia, insomnia,\\nanxiety , and panic disorders.\\nMost of the clinical research with 5-HTP focuses\\non the treatment of depression. In 15 separate studies,\\n5-HTP was tested on a total of 511 patients with dif-\\nferent kinds of depression. Over half (56%) of these\\npatients had significant improvement in depression\\nwhile taking 5-HTP . The compound was found to be\\nas effective as the selective serotonin reuptake in-\\nhibitor (SSRI) fluvoxamine and the tricyclic antide-\\npressants, chloripramine and imipramine. Most of\\nthese studies used relatively high doses ranging from\\n50–3,250 mg daily .\\nThree clinical studies have found that 5-HTP can\\nsignificantly improve the pain , anxiety , morning stiff-\\nness, and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. The\\ndoses ranged from 300–400 mg daily . In one study , 5-\\nHTP treatment was as effective as a tricyclic antidepres-\\nsant (amitriptyline) and monamine oxidase inhibitors\\n(MAOI; pargilyne or phenelzine).\\nThree clinical studies have found that 5-HTP use led\\nto decreased intake of food, and subsequent weight loss in\\nobese patients. The dose used in one study was 900 mg\\ndaily , which initially caused nausea in 80% of the patients.\\nA few clinical trials have found that 5-HTP can ef-\\nfectively prevent chronic headaches, including migraine\\nheadache and tension headache . In addition, 5-HTP\\ncompared favorably with propranolol and methysergide,\\ndrugs commonly used to prevent migraines.\\nIn treating insomnia, 5-HTP is effective because it\\nincreases the length of rapid eye movement (REM)\\nsleep, which improves sleep quality .\\nThe symptoms of anxiety may be significantly re-\\nduced by 5-HTP . In studies, it instilled a sense of relief\\nin patients with panic disorders.\\nOther conditions that may be treated with 5-HTP ,\\nbut for which no studies exist, include chronic fatigue\\nsyndrome, premenstrual syndrome, Parkinson’s\\ndisease, and seizure disorders (such as epilepsy).\\nAlthough 5-HTP may be a useful alternative to con-\\nventional antidepressant drugs, one study indicated that it\\nmay be of no value for patients who have failed to respond\\nto traditional drugs. In this study , patients who failed to re-\\nspond to tricyclic antidepressants were treated with either\\n5-HTP or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I). Half\\nof the patients improved with the MAO-I treatment, while\\nnone showed any benefit from 5-HTP treatment.\\nPreparations\\nThe 5-HTP preparation that is available commercially\\nis isolated from the seed of an African plant called Griffo-\\nnia simplicifolia. It is available as an enteric coated tablet,\\nwhich does not break down until it reaches the intestine.\\nThe recommended starting dose for headaches,\\nweight loss, depression, and fibromyalgia is 50 mg three\\ntimes daily . It can be taken with food. However, for\\nweight loss it should be taken 20 minutes before eating.\\nIf it is not effective after two weeks, the dose may be in-\\ncreased to 100 mg three times daily , but only with the\\nrecommendation of a physician. Insomnia is treated with\\n25 mg (which may be increased to 100 mg after a few\\ndays) taken 30-45 minutes before bedtime.\\nPrecautions\\nThe Mayo Clinic detected, and the U. S. Federal\\nDrug Administration (FDA) confirmed, the presence of a\\ncontaminant (peak X) in 5-HTP produced by six differ-\\nent manufacturers. This contaminant is similar to one\\nfound in L-tryptophan, which in 1989 caused the poten-\\ntially fatal eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (EMS) in\\nsome persons. The L-tryptophan supplements were sub-\\nsequently banned by the FDA. There have been 10 re-\\nports of EMS associated with 5-HTP use. The 5-HTP\\ncontaminant was not at levels high enough to cause ill-\\nness. However, taking excessive doses of 5-HTP may\\nlead to toxic levels of peak X.\\nLong term studies on the safety of 5-HTP use have\\nnot been conducted.

The flax plant is a small, single-\\nstemmed annual that grows to about 2 ft (0.6 m) tall and\\nhas grayish green leaves and sky-blue flowers. Histori-\\ncally , flax has been cultivated for thousands of years.\\nLinen made from flax has been found in the tombs of\\nEgyptian pharaohs and is referred to in the Bible and in\\nHomer’s Odyssey . The Roman naturalist Pliny wrote\\nabout the laxative and therapeutic powers of flax in the\\nfirst century \\nA.D., and many authorities believe it has\\nbeen used as a folk remedy since ancient times. Flax is\\nbelieved to be native to Egypt, but its origins are ques-\\ntionable since it has been used widely around the world.\\nIt is cultivated in many places, including Europe, South\\nAmerica, Asia, and parts of the United States. Only the\\nseeds (flaxseed) and oil of the flax plant (flaxseed oil)\\nare used medicinally . Linseed oil is the term usually used\\nfor the oil found in polishes, varnishes, and paints.\\nFlaxseed oil is derived from the flax plant’s crushed\\nseeds, which resemble common sesame seeds but are\\ndarker. The amber oil is very rich in a type of fat called\\nalpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid that is\\ngood for the heart and found in certain plants. High\\namounts of omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish and\\nsmaller amounts are found in green leafy vegetables,\\nsoy-derived foods, and nuts. Many doctors consider\\nthese acids important for cardiovascular health. Studies\\nsuggest that they can lower triglyceride levels and reduce\\nblood pressure. Omega-3 fatty acids may also decrease\\nthe risk of heart attacks and strokes by preventing the\\nformation of dangerous blood clots within arteries. In\\nhigh dosages, the fatty acids may help to alleviate arthri-\\ntis, though flaxseed products have not yet been shown to\\nbe effective for this purpose.\\nIn addition to omega-3 fatty acids, flaxseed products\\nalso contain potentially therapeutic chemicals called lig-\\nnans. Lignans are believed to have antioxidant properties\\nand may also act as phytoestrogens, very weak forms of\\nestrogen found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and\\nbeans. Unlike human estrogen, phytoestrogens have dual\\nproperties: they can mimic the effects of the hormone in\\nsome parts of the body while blocking its effects in oth-\\ners. Many herbalists believe that phytoestrogens can be\\nuseful in the prevention or treatment of a variety of dis-\\neases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and os-\\nteoporosis. The estrogen-blocking effects of phytoestro-\\ngens may be particularly effective at combating certain\\ncancers that depend on hormones, such as cancers of the\\nbreast or uterus. W omen who consume large amounts of\\nlignans appear to have lower rates of breast cancer. The\\nfact that heart disease and certain cancers occur less fre-\\nquently in Asian countries is sometimes attributed to a\\ndiet rich in plant foods containing phytoestrogens.\\nGeneral use\\nWhile not approved by the United States Food and\\nDrug Administration (FDA), flaxseed products are reput-\\ned to have a number of beneficial effects. Flaxseed is\\nsometimes referred to as a nutraceutical, a recently\\ncoined term that includes any food or food ingredient\\nthought to confer health benefits, including preventing\\nand treating disease. Several studies, some conducted in\\npeople, suggest that flaxseed products (or agents con-\\ntained in them) may help to keep the heart and cardio-\\nvascular system healthy . Flaxseed products may lower\\ncholesterol levels, help control blood pressure, and may\\nreduce the buildup of plaque in arteries. T est tube and rat\\nstudies suggest that chemicals in flaxseed may help to\\nprevent or shrink cancerous tumors. Due to its estrogen-\\nlike effects, some women use flaxseed oil to ease breast\\ntenderness, alleviate symptoms of premenstrual syn-\\ndrome (PMS), and help control menopausal symptoms.\\nFlaxseed oil has also been recommended to treat skin\\nconditions, inflammation, and arthritis. It is usually\\ntaken internally for all the purposes mentioned above.\\nThe oil may be used externally to help the healing of\\nscalds and burns.\\nMore recently , flaxseed has been shown to be bene-\\nficial for people suffering from digestive disorders. It is\\nnow recommended as an “effective herbal agent” for\\ntreating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\\nThe link between flaxseed and heart disease has\\nbeen examined in a number of published studies. One of\\nthese studies published in the journal Atherosclerosis in\\n1997, observed the effects of adding flaxseed to the diet\\nof rabbits with atherosclerosis . Researchers found that\\nflaxseed reduced the development of plaque build-up by\\nalmost 50%. The authors concluded that flaxseed may\\nhelp to prevent heart attacks and strokes related to high\\ncholesterol levels. A study involving several dozen men\\nwith mild high blood pressure, which was published in\\nthe Journal of Human Hypertension in 1990, suggests\\nthat flaxseed oil may slightly lower blood pressure.\\nResearch also suggests that flaxseed products may\\nhave potential as cancer fighters. One study , published in\\nCancer Letters in 1998, investigated how dietary\\nflaxseed affects the development of cancer. Mice were\\nfed a diet supplemented with 2.5%, 5%, or 10% flaxseed\\nfor several weeks before and after being injected with\\ncancerous cells. The more flaxseed the mice received,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 765\\nFlaxseed\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 765'),\n",

In addition, flaxseed is\\nincluded in a rapidly expanding list of nutraceutical prod-\\nucts for dogs, cats, and other domestic pets.\\nPreparations\\nFlaxseed products are commercially available as\\nwhole or ground seeds, gelatin capsules, and oil. Some\\nherbalists recommend adding the ground or whole seeds\\nto the diet to get the maximum benefit from the herb.\\nWhole seeds can be stored in a cool, dry place for up to\\none year. Crushed seeds should be used immediately or\\nfrozen for future use. No standard guidelines have been\\nestablished on how much of these forms should be con-\\nsumed. Research subjects have been given as much as\\n1/4 cup of ground flaxseed per day , but a Canadian nu-\\ntrition expert suggests that 1–2 tablespoons per day is\\nenough for most adults.\\nSeveral nutraceutical companies are marketing a\\nflaxseed ingredient as of 2002. The flaxseed ingredient is\\na fine-milled flour with 5% lignan content, intended for\\naddition to commercial baked goods, snack foods, cere-\\nals, dry pet foods, and similar products.\\nCapsules can be taken according to package direc-\\ntions. Some herbalists feel that the capsules available are\\nhighly processed, contain fewer beneficial properties,\\nand may be an expensive alternative to flaxseed oil.\\nThe optimum daily dosage of flaxseed oil has not\\nbeen established. Usually , 1 tablespoon daily of the oil\\ncan be taken for general health. As a remedy , 1-3 table-\\nspoons may be taken daily based on the person’s weight\\nand health needs. Some people consume the oil as an in-\\ngredient in salad dressing. The oil is often combined\\nwith limewater when used to treat burns and scalds.\\nPrecautions\\nFlaxseed products are not known to be harmful\\nwhen taken in recommended dosages, though it is im-\\nportant to remember that the long-term effects of taking\\nflax-derived remedies (in any amount) have not been\\nstudied. Due to lack of sufficient medical study , flaxseed\\nproducts should be used with caution in children, women\\nwho are pregnant or breast-feeding, and people with\\nliver or kidney disease.\\nBecause flaxseed oil tends to become rancid rela-\\ntively quickly , it should be kept in the refrigerator. While\\nthe oil may be added to cooked food, it should not be\\nused during cooking because heat can destroy the effec-\\ntiveness of the oil.\\nPersons who are adding ground flaxseed to their diet\\nfor its fiber content are advised to start off with small\\namounts and increase them gradually , and to drink plenty\\nof water. Otherwise the high fiber content of flaxseed\\ncan produce intestinal cramping and diarrhea.\\nConsumers should read the labels of all flaxseed\\nproducts to insure that the product is for medicinal or nu-\\ntritional purposes.\\nSide effects\\nWhen taken in recommended dosages, flaxseed prod-\\nucts are not associated with any significant side effects.\\nInteractions\\nConsumers should consult their healthcare profes-\\nsional for information on flaxseed products and interac-\\ntions with medications and other remedies. More specifi-\\ncally , the omega-3 fatty acids in flaxseed may increase the\\nblood-thinning effects of such medications as aspirin or\\nwarfarin.

They\\nare prescribed according to a patient’s emotional disposi-\\ntion, as ascertained by the therapist, doctor, or patients\\nthemselves.\\nOrigins\\nPerhaps the most famous and widely used system is\\nthe Bach flower remedies. This system originated in the\\n1920s when British physician and bacteriologist, Dr. Ed-\\nward Bach (1886–1936), noticed that patients with phys-\\nical complaints often seemed to be suffering from anxi-\\nety or some kind of negative emotion. He concluded that\\nassessing a patient’s emotional disposition and prescrib-\\ning an appropriate flower essence could treat the physi-\\ncal illness. Bach was a qualified medical doctor, but he\\nalso practiced homeopathy.\\nAs a result of his own serious illness in 1917, Bach\\nbegan a search for a new and simple system of medicine\\nthat would treat the whole person. In 1930, he gave up\\nhis flourishing practice on Harley Street at the Royal\\nLondon Homeopathic Hospital and moved to the coun-\\ntryside to devote his life to this research. It is known that\\nat this point, he ceased to dispense the mixture of home-\\nopathy and allopathic medicine that he had been using.\\nInstead, he began investigating the healing properties of\\nplant essences and discovered that he possessed an “intu-\\netary supplements, as it will slow down the body’s ab-\\nsorption of them.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGruenwald, Joerg.

Accord-\\ningly , he developed the system of treatment that bears his\\nname, and is also the foundation for all other flower-\\nremedy systems.\\nThe Bach Flower Remedies were ostensibly the\\nonly system of significance from the 1920s until the\\n1970s, when there was a renewed interest in the subject\\nby doctors working in the field of natural medicine. Per-\\nhaps the most notable was Dr. Richard Katz, who was\\nseeking new methods of dealing with modern stress and\\nthe resulting ailments. He focused on the concept of a\\npsychic, psychological effect and chose to pursue this\\nline of research.\\nIn 1979, Katz founded the Flower Essence Society\\nin California, (FES). This society pledged to further the\\nresearch and development of Bach’s principles. As of\\n2000, FES hosts a database of over 100 flower essences\\nfrom more than 50 countries. FES is now an internation-\\nal organization of health practitioners, researchers, stu-\\ndents, and others concerned with flower essence therapy .\\nThe Society has connections with an estimated\\n50,000 active practitioners from around the world, who\\nuse flower essence therapy as part of their treatment.\\nFES encourages the study of the plants themselves to de-\\ntermine the characteristics of flower essences. They are\\ncompiling an extensive database of case studies and\\npractitioner reports of the use of essences therapeutical-\\nly , allowing verification and development of the original\\ndefinitions. They are also engaged in the scientific study\\nof flower essence therapy .\\nFES says they have developed the theories of Paracel-\\nsus and Goethe who researched the “signatures” and “ges-\\ntures” of botanical specimens, on the premise that the\\nhuman body and soul are a reflection of the system of na-\\nture. FES plant research interprets the therapeutic proper-\\nties of flower essences according to these insights.\\nIn this regard, they have devised 12 “windows of\\nperception” for monitoring the attributes of plants. Each\\nof these windows reveals an aspect of the plant’ s quali-\\nties, although they maintain that what they are seeking is\\na “whole which is greater than the sum of its parts. ” The\\n12 windows are not considered independent classifica-\\ntions, but more of a blended tapestry of views of the\\nqualities that each plant possesses.\\nThe first window is concerned with the “form” of a\\nplant—its shape classification. The second focuses on its\\n“gesture” or spatial relationship. The third window is a\\nplant’s botanical classification; the Flower Essence Soci-\\nety maintains that considering a plant’s botanical family is\\nessential to obtaining an overview of its properties as a\\nflower essence. The fourth window concerns the time ori-\\nentation of a particular specimen regarding the daily and\\nseasonal cycles. Why do some flowers bloom at different\\ntimes of the day , while others, such as the evening prim-\\nrose, respond to the moon? The fifth window observes a\\nplant’s relationship to its environment. Where a plant\\nchooses to grow , and where it cannot survive, reveals\\nmuch about its qualities. The sixth window observes a\\nplant’s relationship to the Four Elements and the Four\\nEthers, as FES maintains that plants exist in one of the ele-\\nmental or etheric forces in addition to their physical life.\\n“Elements” refers to those developed by the Greeks, as\\nopposed to the modern concept of “molecular building\\nblocks. ” It seems that commonly , two elements predomi-\\nnate in a plant, indicating a polarity of qualities, while two\\ncan be said to be recessive. The seventh window relates to\\na plant’s relationship with the other kingdoms of nature:\\nmineral, animal and human, while the eighth relates to the\\ncolor and color variations of a plant. Katz explains how\\nthe language of color tells us so much about the “soul\\nqualities” of a plant. The ninth window concerns all other\\nsensory perceptions of a plant, such as fragrance, texture,\\nand taste. The tenth window involves assessing the chemi-\\ncal substances and properties; the eleventh studies medici-\\nnal and herbal uses, as by studying the physical healing\\nproperties of plants, we can also understand something of\\ntheir more subtle effects on the soul. Finally , the twelfth\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 769\\nFlower remedies\\nEdward Bach was a graduate of University College\\nHospital (M.B., B.S., M.R.C.S.) in England. He left his\\nflourishing Harley Street practice in favor of homeopa-\\nthy , seeking a more natural system of healing than allo-\\npathic medicine. He concluded that healing should be\\nas simple and natural as the development of plants,\\nwhich were nourished and given healing properties by\\nearth, air , water , and sun.\\nBach believed that he could sense the individual\\nhealing properties of flowers by placing his hands over\\nthe petals. His remedies were prepared by floating sum-\\nmer flowers in a bowl of clear stream water exposed to\\nsunlight for three hours.\\nHe developed 38 remedies, one for each of the\\nnegative states of mind suffered by human beings,\\nwhich he classified under seven group headings: fear ,\\nuncertainty , insufficient interest in present circum-\\nstances, loneliness, over sensitivity to influences and\\nideas, despondency or despair , and overcare for the\\nwelfare of others.

They have been described as “liquid\\nenergy . ” The theory is that they encapsulate the flowers’\\nhealing energy , and are said to deal with and overcome\\nnegative emotions, and so relieve blockages in the flow\\nof human energy that can cause illness.\\nDescription\\nBecause flower remedies operate on approximately\\nthe same principles as homeopathy , practitioners quite\\noften prescribe the two therapies in conjunction with\\neach other. They can also be used concurrently with allo-\\npathic medicine.\\nThe system consists of 38 remedies, each for a dif-\\nferent disposition. The basic theory is that if the remedy\\nfor the correct disposition is chosen, the physical illness\\nresulting from the present emotional state can then be\\ncured.

This became impractical when his treatment became\\nso popular that production could not keep up with de-\\nmand. He then set about finding a way to manufacture the\\nremedies, and found that floating the freshly picked petals\\non the surface of spring water in a glass bowl and leaving\\nthem in strong sunlight for three hours produced the de-\\nsired effect. Therapists explain that the water is “poten-\\ntized” by the essence of the flowers. The potentized water\\ncan then be bottled and sold. For more woody specimens,\\nthe procedure is to boil them in a sterilized pan of water\\nfor 30 minutes. These two methods produce “mother tinc-\\ntures” and the same two methods devised by Bach are still\\nused today . Flower essences do not contain any artificial\\nchemical substances, except for alcohol preservative.\\nBach remedies cost around $10 each, and there is no\\nset time limit for treatment. It may take days, weeks, or in\\nsome cases months. Flower essences cost around $6 each,\\nand there is also no set time for the length of treatment, or\\nthe amount of essences that may be taken. These treat-\\nments are not generally covered by medical insurance.\\nPrecautions\\nBach remedies and flower essences are not difficult\\nto understand, and are considered suitable for self ad-\\nministration. The only difficulty may be in finding the\\ncorrect remedy , as it can sometimes be tricky to pinpoint\\nan individual’s emotional disposition. They are even safe\\nfor babies, children, and animals. An important aspect of\\ntreatment with flower remedies, is that if you feel in-\\nstinctively that you need a particular remedy , you are en-\\ncouraged to act on that instinct. However, it is advisable\\nnot to continue a particular remedy once you feel you no\\nlonger need it, and to try a different one if you feel that\\nprogress is not being made.\\nThe remedies are administered from a stoppered bot-\\ntle and need to be diluted. Individuals sensitive to alcohol\\ncan apply the concentrate directly to temples, wrists, be-\\nhind the ears, or underarms. They should be kept in a cool\\ndark place; like this they should last indefinitely . Howev-\\ner, a diluted remedy should not be kept longer than three\\nweeks. T wo drops of each diluted remedy should be taken\\nfour times a day , including first thing in the morning and\\nlast thing at night. If the rescue remedy is being used,\\nfour drops should be used instead. Most therapists recom-\\nmend that they be taken in spring water, but the remedy\\ncan be taken directly from the bottle, if care is taken that\\nthe dropper does not touch the tongue, as this would in-\\ntroduce bacteria that would spoil the remedy .\\nIt is not recommended that more than six or seven\\nBach remedies be used at any one time. Instead, it is\\npreferable to divide a larger amount up into two lots to\\nensure the optimum effectiveness of the remedies. No\\ncombination, or amount of combinations of the remedies\\ncan cause any harm, rather they become less effective.\\nUnlike FES, the Bach Centre does not encourage re-\\nsearch to “prove” that the remedies work, preferring that\\npeople find out for themselves. They strive to keep the use of\\nthe Bach remedies as simple as possible, and to this end they\\ndo not keep case records. Bach warned before he died that\\nothers would try to change his work and make it more com-\\nplicated. He was determined to keep it simple so that anyone\\ncould use it, and that is why he limited the system to only 38\\nremedies. The Centre points out that many who have used\\nBach’s research as a starting point have added other reme-\\ndies to the list, even some that Bach himself rejected.\\nSide effects\\nFlower remedies or essences are generally regarded as\\nbeing totally safe, and there are no known side effects apart\\nfrom the rare appearance of a slight rash, which is not a\\nreason to discontinue treatment, says the Bach Centre.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nBach flower remedies and flower essences have not\\nyet officially won the support of allopathic medicine, de-\\nspite the fact that more and more medical doctors are re-\\nferring patients for such treatments on the strength of\\npersonal conviction. However, it is difficult to discount\\nthe scores of testimonials. Some practitioners refer skep-\\ntics to the research that has been done regarding the\\n“auras” of living things. Theoretically , the stronger the\\naura, the more alive an organism is. Flower essences\\nhave very strong auras.\\nAmong mainstream medical practitioners, psychia-\\ntrists and family practitioners appear to be more willing\\nto study flower essences than physicians in other special-\\nties. One pilot study at Penn State Hershey Medical Cen-\\nter found that the Bach flower essences were effective in\\nreducing the symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivi-\\nty disorder (ADHD) in children as measured by two\\nstandard assessment instruments for ADHD.\\nAnother area of medicine in which acceptance of\\nBach flower essences is growing is small-animal veteri-\\nnary practice. T wo full-length books on the use of flower\\nessences for behavioral problems in animals were pub-\\nlished in 1999, and some schools of veterinary medicine\\nnow include flower essences as part of elective courses\\nin holistic or complementary veterinary treatments.\\nT raining & certification\\nThe official Bach International Education Program\\ntraining courses are all recognized by the Dr. Edward\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 771\\nFlower remedies\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 771'),\n",

Polygonum is a member of the Polygonaceae\\nfamily of plants. In Chinese herbalism, fo ti is called he\\nshou wu or ho shou wu. Other names are fleeceflower and\\nChinese cornbind. In Japan the herb is called kashuu. It is\\none of the most popular herbs in Oriental medicine, used\\nas an overall health tonic, as a tincture to increase longevi-\\nty , and as a remedy for various health conditions.\\nFo ti is a perennial flowering vine that reaches\\nheights of 3–6 ft (0.97–1.8 m). It is native to southwest-\\nern China, Japan and T aiwan, but can be cultivated in\\nmany regions, including parts of North America.\\nThe root of the plant is the part most frequently used\\nfor medicinal purposes, although Chinese herbalists occa-\\nsionally use the stems for different applications. The root\\nhas a sweet and slightly bitter taste. Chinese herbalists\\nclaim it has slightly warming effects in the body , and works\\nby increasing levels of blood and vital essence. These are\\ntwo of three essential substances in the body , according to\\nChinese medicine. Chinese herbalists also maintain that fo\\nti strengthens the liver and kidneys. Fo ti root is used in con-\\njunction with other herbs in many medicinal tonics.\\nResearch in the W est has shown that fo ti has antitu-\\nmor and antibacterial properties. It also lowers blood pres-\\nsure (hypotensive effects) and increases circulation (va-\\nsodilatory effects). Fo ti contains emodin and rhein, two\\nlaxative agents that have shown promising anti-cancer ac-\\ntivity as well. Fo ti also contains lecithin, a B vitamin that\\naids in fat metabolism and lowers cholesterol. Researchers\\nhave isolated a flavonoid in fo ti called catachin, which is\\nalso found in green tea. Catachin inhibits tumor cells and\\nhas antioxidant effects, which may be the source of the\\nanti-aging properties that the herb is known for in China.\\nGeneral use\\nFo ti is recommended for many conditions. It is used\\nas an overall health strengthener, and to prevent premature\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2772\\nFo ti KEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAura—Emanation of light from living things\\n(plants and animals) that can be recorded by Kir-\\nlian photography .\\nEssence —The constituent of a plant that deter-\\nmines its characteristics.\\nPotentization —The process of transferring the\\nhealing energy of a plant into spring water .\\nWindow —A perspective adopted to assess the\\nproperty of a given plant.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 772'),\n",

These vitamins help the\\nbody break down complex carbohydrates into simple sugars\\nthat can be readily used for energy . Excess B vitamins are\\nexcreted from the body rather than stored for later use. This\\nis why sufficient daily intake of folic acid is necessary .\\nFolic acid is also known as folate, or folacin. It is\\none of the nutrients most often found to be deficient in\\nthe W estern diet, and there is evidence that deficiency is\\na problem worldwide. Folic acid is found in leafy green\\nvegetables, beans, peas and lentils, liver, beets, Brussels\\nsprouts, poultry , nutritional yeast, tuna, wheat germ ,\\nmushrooms, oranges, asparagus, broccoli, spinach, ba-\\nnanas, strawberries, and cantaloupes. In 1998, the U.S.\\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) required food\\nmanufacturers to add folic acid to enriched bread and\\ngrain products, to boost intake and to help prevent neural\\ntube defects (NTD) in the fetus during pregnancy.\\nGeneral use\\nFolic acid works together with vitamin B12 and vit-\\namin C to metabolize protein. It is important for the for-\\nmation of red and white blood cells. Folic acid is neces-\\nsary for the proper differentiation and growth of cells,\\nand for the development of the fetus. It is also used to\\nform the nucleic acid of DNA and RNA. It increases the\\nappetite, stimulates the production of stomach acid for\\ndigestion, and aids in maintaining a healthy liver. A folic\\nacid deficiency may lead to megaloblastic anemia ,i n\\nwhich there is decreased production of red blood cells,\\nand the cells that are produced are abnormally large.\\nThis reduces the amounts of oxygen and nutrients that\\nare able to reach the tissues. Symptoms may include fa-\\ntigue , reduced secretion of digestive acids, confusion,\\nand forgetfulness. During pregnancy , a folic acid defi-\\nciency may lead to preeclampsia, premature birth, and\\nincreased bleeding after birth.\\nPeople who are at high risk for strokes and heart\\ndisease may benefit from folic acid supplements. An ele-\\nvated blood level of the amino acid homocysteine has\\nbeen identified as a risk factor for some of these dis-\\neases. High levels of homocysteine have also been found\\nto contribute to problems with osteoporosis . Folic acid,\\ntogether with vitamins B\\n6 and B 12, aids in the break-\\ndown of homocysteine, and may help reverse the prob-\\nlems associated with elevated levels.\\nPregnant women have an increased need for folic\\nacid, both for themselves and their unborn child. Folic\\nacid is necessary for the proper growth and development\\nof the fetus. Adequate intake of folic acid is vital for the\\nprevention of several types of birth defects, particularly\\nneural tube defects (NTDs). The neural tube of the em-\\nbryo develops into the brain, spinal cord, spinal column,\\nand the skull. If this tube forms incompletely during the\\nfirst few months of pregnancy , a serious—and often\\nfatal— defect such as spina bifida or anencephaly , may\\noccur. Folic acid, taken from one year to one month be-\\nfore conception through the first four months of preg-\\nnancy , can reduce the risk of NTDs by 50–70%. It also\\nhelps prevent cleft lip and palate.\\nResearch shows that folic acid can be used to suc-\\ncessfully treat cervical dysplasia , a condition that is di-\\nagnosed by a Pap smear, and consists of abnormal cells\\nin the cervix. This condition is considered to be a possi-\\nble precursor to cervical cancer . Daily consumption of\\n1,000 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid for three or more\\nmonths has resulted in improved cervical cells upon re-\\npeat Pap smears.\\nStudies suggest that long-term use of folic acid sup-\\nplements may also help prevent lung and colon cancers.\\nResearchers have also found that alcoholics who have\\nlow folic acid levels face a greatly increased chance of\\ndeveloping colon cancer.\\nPreparations\\nSupplements are taken to correct a folic acid defi-\\nciency . Since the functioning of the B vitamins is interre-\\nlated, it is generally recommended that the appropriate\\ndose of B-complex vitamins be taken in place of single B\\nvitamin supplements. The Recommended Dietary Al-\\nlowance (RDA) for folate is 400 mcg per day for adults,\\n600 mcg per day for pregnant women, and 500 mcg\\ndaily for nursing women. Medicinal dosages of up to\\n1,000 to 2,000 mcg per day may be prescribed.\\nPrecautions\\nFolic acid is not stable. It is easily destroyed by ex-\\nposure to light, air, water, and cooking. Therefore, the\\nsupplement should be stored inside a dark container in a\\ncold, dry place, such as a refrigerator. Many medications\\ninterfere with the body’s absorption and ability to use\\nfolic acid. These medications include sulfa drugs, sleep-\\ning pills, estrogen, anti-convulsants, birth control pills,\\nantacids, quinine, and some antibiotics.\\nThe anemia caused by folic acid deficiency is identi-\\ncal to that caused by lack of vitamin B\\n12. Using large\\namounts of folic acid (e.g., over 5,000 mcg per day) can\\nmask a vitamin B\\n12 deficiency , since the anemia will im-\\nprove but the other effects of vitamin B 12 deficiency will\\ncontinue. This can lead to irreversible nerve damage.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2774\\nFolic acid\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 774'),\n",

Symp-\\ntoms of bacterial food poisoning occur because foodborne\\nbacteria release enterotoxins, or poisons, as a byproduct of\\ntheir growth in the body . These toxins often diminish the\\nabsorptive ability of the intestines and cause the secretion\\nof water and electrolytes that leads to dehydration. The\\nseverity of symptoms depends on the type of bacteria, the\\namount of bacteria and food consumed, and the individ-\\nual’s health and sensitivity to the bacteria’s toxin.\\nSALMONELLA. Symptoms of poisoning begin 12–72\\nhours after eating food contaminated with Salmonella .\\nClassic food poisoning symptoms, including fever, occur\\nfor about two to five days. Salmonella is usually trans-\\nmitted through the consumption of food contaminated by\\nhuman or other animal feces. This contamination is\\nmostly due to lack of hand washing by food handlers.\\nESCHERICHIA COLI (E. COLI ). Symptoms of food\\npoisoning from E. coli 0157:H7 and similar strains of E.\\ncoli are slower to appear than those caused by some of\\nthe other foodborne bacteria. One to three days after eat-\\ning contaminated food, the victim begins to have severe\\nabdominal cramps and watery diarrhea that usually be-\\ncomes bloody . The diarrhea may consist mostly of blood\\nand very little stool, so the condition is sometimes called\\nhemorrhagic colitis. There is little or no fever, the bloody\\ndiarrhea lasts from one to eight days, and the condition\\nusually resolves by itself. Food contamination from E.\\ncoli O157:H7 has mostly been found in raw or under-\\ncooked ground beef. Raw milk has also been a source of\\nfood poisoning by E. coli.\\nCAMPYLOBACTER JEJUNI . C. jejuni infections are\\nmost often caused by contaminated chicken, but unchlo-\\nrinated water and raw milk may also be sources of infec-\\ntion. Classic symptoms of food poisoning, including\\nfever and diarrhea, begin two to five days after consum-\\ning food or water contaminated with C. jejuni. The diar-\\nrhea may be watery and may contain blood. Symptoms\\nlast from seven to 10 days, and relapses occur in about\\none quarter of the people who are infected.\\nST APHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS (STAPH). Staph is\\nspread primarily by food handlers with Staph infections\\non their skin. However, contaminated equipment and\\nfood preparation surfaces may also be at fault. Almost\\nany food can be contaminated, but salad dressings, milk\\nproducts, cream pastries, and food kept at room tempera-\\nture, rather than hot or cold, are likely candidates. Clas-\\nsic symptoms of food poisoning appear rapidly , usually\\ntwo to eight hours after the contaminated food is eaten.\\nSuch symptoms usually last only three to six hours and\\nrarely more than two days. Most cases are mild and the\\nvictim recovers without any assistance.\\nSHIGELLA. Symptoms of food poisoning by Shigella\\nappear 36–72 hours after eating contaminated food.\\nThese symptoms are slightly different from those associ-\\nated with most foodborne bacteria. In addition to the fa-\\nmiliar symptoms of food poisoning, up to 40% of chil-\\ndren with severe infections show neurological symp-\\ntoms.

This is followed by\\ntingling and numbness of the face, hands, and feet. Clas-\\nsic symptoms of food poisoning are accompanied by\\nother neurological symptoms such as light-headedness,\\nheadache, and unsteady gait. The second stage of tetrado-\\ntoxin poisoning brings on a progressive paralysis.

The toxins are then accumu-\\nlated in the bodies of the shellfish. Cockles, mussels,\\nclams, oysters, and scallops are most often affected.\\nSometimes the toxin-producing algae multiply to such an\\nextent that they cause the waters they live in to take on the\\nreddish color of their bodies.

After consumption of the fish, immediate fa-\\ncial flushing and hives may occur, as well as classic\\nsymptoms of food poisoning becoming evident a few\\nminutes later. Symptoms usually last less than 24 hours.\\nMushroom poisoning\\nMushroom poisoning is classified by the effects of\\nthe poisons. Protoplasmic poisons result in cell destruc-\\ntion, often in the liver, which progresses to complete\\norgan failure. Neurotoxins cause neurological symptoms\\nsuch as sweating, convulsions, hallucinations, excite-\\nment, depression , coma, and colon spasms. Gastroin-\\ntestinal (G/I) irritants rapidly bring on the classic symp-\\ntoms of food poisoning and then resolve just as quickly .\\nDisulfiram-like poisons are generally nontoxic, except\\nwhen alcohol is consumed within 72 hours of eating\\nthem. In these cases, the poisons cause headache, nau-\\nsea, vomiting, flushing, and cardiac disturbances for two\\nto three hours.\\nOther possible sources\\nOther possible sources of food poisoning include in-\\ngestion of green or sprouting raw potatoes, ingestion of\\nfava beans by susceptible persons, and ergot poisoning\\nfrom ingestion of contaminated grain. Chemical contam-\\ninant food poisoning may result from the ingestion of\\nunwashed produce sprayed with arsenic, lead, or insecti-\\ncides. Food served or stored in lead-glazed pottery cad-\\nmium-lined containers may also lead to food poisoning.\\nDiagnosis\\nAn important aspect of diagnosing food poisoning is\\nthe clinical interview . A history of the illness should be\\nthoroughly traced to include ingestion of food, recent\\ntravel, and contact with those showing similar symptoms\\nof illness. Because it may take 30 minutes to three days\\nfor symptoms to develop, it is not necessarily the most\\nrecent food eaten that is the cause of the symptoms. Di-\\nagnosis is confirmed with a stool culture. Other laborato-\\nry tests may be used to examine vomitus, blood, or the\\ncontaminated food. A blood chemistry panel may be per-\\nformed to determine the extent of any tissue damage or\\nelectrolyte imbalances. Many cases of food poisoning go\\nundiagnosed, and treatment focuses on the short-lived\\nG/I symptoms.\\nBotulism is usually diagnosed from its distinctive\\nneurological symptoms, since rapid treatment is essential\\nto save the patient’s life. Electromyography , a test ana-\\nlyzing the electrical activity of muscles, may later be\\ndone to further confirm diagnosis. The test shows abnor-\\nmal muscle activity in most cases of botulism.\\nT reatment\\nThose suffering from food poisoning should reduce\\nall sugar and normal food for eight to 24 hours, and in-\\ncrease fluids to avoid dehydration. Charcoal tablets, Lac-\\ntobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and cit-\\nrus seed extract are all recommended. For mild cases of\\nfood poisoning, the homeopathic remedies Arsenicum\\nalbum, V eratrum album, P odophyllum, or Nux vomica\\nare recommended. The remedy should be given in 12c\\npotency every three to four hours until symptoms sub-\\nside. If a ready-made electrolyte replacement is not\\navailable, a homemade one can be made by dissolving\\nexactly 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt and 4 tsp (20 ml) of sugar in 1\\nqt (1 l) of water.\\nCinnamon ( Cinnamonum zeylanicum) , cloves\\n(Syzigium aromaticum) , oregano ( Origanum vulgare ),\\nand sage (Salvia officinalis ) are food herbs that are also\\nstrong inhibitors of bacteria. Liberal amounts can be\\nadded to foods, especially when traveling. Grapefruit\\nseed extract has a natural antibiotic effect and may be of\\nhelp.

It was first known\\nby the Anglo-Saxon name foxes glofa (the glove of the\\nfox), because its flowers look like the fingers of a\\nglove. This name is also thought to be related to a\\nnorthern legend that bad fairies gave the blossoms to\\nthe fox to put on his toes, so that he could muffle his\\nfootfalls while he hunted for prey . The legend may ac-\\ncount in part for some of the common names of digital-\\nis: dead man’s bells, fairy finger, fairy bells, fairy thim-\\nbles, fairy cap, ladies’ thimble, lady-finger, rabbit’s\\nflower, throatwort, flapdock, flopdock, lion’s mouth,\\nand Scotch mercury .\\nFoxglove was first introduced to the United\\nStates as an ornamental garden plant. During the first\\nyear, foxglove produces only leaves. In its second\\nseason it produces a tall, leafy flowering stalk that\\ngrows 3–4 ft (0.9–1.2 m) tall. In early summer, many\\ntubular, bell-shaped flowers bloom; they are about 2\\nin (5.08 cm) long and vary in color from white to\\nlavender and purple.\\nFoxglove was originally used for congestive heart\\nfailure and atrial fibrillation (chaotic contractions across\\nthe atrium of the heart). Foxglove helps the muscles of\\nthe heart to contract, reduces the frequency of heartbeats,\\nand lowers the amount of oxygen the heart needs to\\nwork. The cardiac glycosides in foxglove block an en-\\nzyme that regulates the heart’s electrical activity . The\\ndried leaves, ripe dried seeds, and fresh leaves of the\\none-year-old plant, or the leaves of the two-year old\\nplant are the parts that were used in medicine.\\nIn spite of its use in the past, foxglove has been\\nlargely replaced as a heart medicine by standardized\\npharmaceutical preparations because it is one of the\\nmost dangerous medicinal plants in the world. Foxglove\\nis, in fact, a useful example of the importance of stan-\\ndardization in testing the efficacy and possible toxicity\\nof present-day popular herbal medicines. Its sap, flow-\\ners, seeds, and leaves are all poisonous; the leaves, even\\nwhen dried, contain the largest amount of cardiac glyco-\\nsides. The upper leaves of the stem are more dangerous\\nthan the lower leaves. Foxglove is most toxic just before\\nthe seeds ripen. It tastes spicy hot or bitter and smells\\nslightly bad.\\nIn folk medicine, foxglove was first used in Ireland. Its\\nuse spread to Scotland, England, and then to central Europe.\\nIt was taken to treat abscesses,boils, headaches, paralysis,\\nand stomach ulcers. It was also applied to the body to help\\nwounds heal and to cure ulcers.

It can also be given in an injection.\\nPrecautions\\nUsed improperly , foxglove is deadly; it can make\\nthe heart stop or cause a person to suffocate. Eating any\\npart of the plant can be fatal. The therapeutic dose of\\nfoxglove is very close to the lethal dose. Foxglove\\nshould therefore not be used.\\nAn overdose of foxglove interferes with the heart’s\\nnormal electrical rhythms; it can make the heart beat too\\nslowly or cause extra heartbeats. An overdose of fox-\\nglove may also cause diarrhea , headache , loss of ap-\\npetite, and vomiting. More serious and potentially dead-\\nly reactions to an overdose affect the heart and the cen-\\ntral nervous system. Foxglove can disrupt the heart’s\\nrhythm, including life-threatening ventricular tachycar-\\ndia, or atrial tachycardia with atrioventricular block. In\\nthe central nervous system, foxglove can cause confu-\\nsion, depression, drowsiness, hallucinations, psychoses,\\nand visual disturbances.\\nPoisoning from foxglove occasionally occurs from\\nthe misuse of such herbal preparations as dried foxglove\\nleaves used in a tea, or from overdoses of prescribed dig-\\nitalis. It can also occur when foxglove is confused with\\ncomfrey, a plant used for tea that belongs to the borage\\nfamily . The two herbs look very much alike.\\nSide effects\\nSome patients who take pharmaceutical prepara-\\ntions of digitalis may experience such side effects as too\\nmuch muscle tone in the stomach and intestines, diar-\\nrhea, headache, loss of appetite, and vomiting. These\\nside effects are the same as some symptoms of a fox-\\nglove overdose. Digitalis preparations can have toxic\\nside effects due to overdose or other conditions. The\\nmost serious are arrhythmias, abnormal heart rhythms\\nthat can be life-threatening.\\nInteractions\\nThe use of digitalis can increase the toxicity of other\\ncardioactive drugs. Hypersensitivity to digitalis, dehydra-\\ntion, or the use of diuretics that cause people to lose fluids\\nand salts may increase the risk of side effects from digoxin.\\nThe risk of cardiac arrhythmias is increased when people\\ntaking digitalis also take amphetamines or diet pills; medi-\\ncine for asthma or other breathing problems; or medicine\\nfor colds, sinus problems, hay fever, or other allergies.\\nT aking any of these drugs with digitalis also affects how\\nmuch digitalis is in the body and how effective it will be.\\nassociated with congestive heart failure. Withering pub-\\nlished a paper in 1785 that is considered a classic in the\\nmedical literature. Foxglove was used to treat heart dis-\\nease during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\\nGeneral use\\nFoxglove is no longer used as a heart medicine be-\\ncause the therapeutic dose and the lethal dose are very\\nclose. Seasonal variations in the level of cardiac glyco-\\nsides in the plant make the safe dose impossible to esti-\\nmate except by an experienced physician and prescriber of\\nthe herb who monitors the patient on an hourly basis for\\nsigns of overdose. Few living doctors and herbalists can\\nsafely use digitalis as a plant extract. Specific standardized\\ndoses of pharmaceutical digoxin are used instead. Even\\nso, patients receiving the drug must be closely monitored.\\nPreparations\\nIn present-day usage, foxglove is used as an ingredi-\\nent in a class of heart drugs called digitalis.

The illustrations above feature common sites where fractures occur. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.\\nThe Gale Group)\\ntory and physical exam completed by a physician often\\nprovides enough information to determine if further test-\\ning is necessary . An x ray of the injured area is most\\ncommonly used to determine the presence of a bone\\nfracture. However, it is important to note that not all\\nfractures are apparent on an initial x ray . Rib fractures\\nare often difficult to diagnose and may require several\\nviews at different angles. If the fracture is open and oc-\\ncurs in conjunction with soft tissue injury , further labora-\\ntory studies may have to be done.\\nIn the event of stress fractures, a tuning fork can\\nprovide a simple, inexpensive test. The tuning fork is a\\nmetal instrument with a stem and two prongs that vibrate\\nwhen struck. If a patient has increased pain when the\\ntuning fork is placed on the bone, such as the lower leg\\nbone or shinbone, the likelihood of a stress fracture is\\nhigh. Bone scans also are helpful in detecting stress frac-\\ntures or other difficult-to-detect fractures.\\nT reatment\\nPrevention is the most effective way to avoid frac-\\ntures. W earing protective gear, such as a helmet, or using\\nprotective equipment, such as safety gear, while playing\\nsports may greatly reduce the risk of a fracture.\\nA daily multivitamin and mineral supplement (for\\ninstance, containing calcium, magnesium, boron, stron-\\ntium) is recommended to help build and maintain a\\nhealthy , resilient skeleton. These, together with an ade-\\nquate protein intake, will also help rebuild the bone and\\nsurrounding tissue. Some physical therapists use electro-\\nstimulation over a fractured site to promote and expedite\\nhealing. Chinese traditional medicine seeks to reconnect\\nthe qi through the meridian lines along the line of a frac-\\nture. Homeopathy can enhance the body’s healing\\nprocess.

Arnica montana, Calendula offic-\\ninalis, St. John’s wort, or comfrey salves or ointments can\\nimprove healing when applied externally , as well.\\nAfter initial treatments, the application of contrast\\nhydrotherapy to a hand or foot below the area of the\\nfracture can be used to assist healing by enhancing circu-\\nlation. Contrast hydrotherapy uses an alternating series\\nof hot and cold water applications. Either compresses or\\nbasins of water may be used. First, hot compress is ap-\\nplied for three minutes. It is followed by cold water for\\n30 seconds. These applications are repeated three times\\neach, ending with the cold water.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nBroken bones need to be treated as soon as possible\\nby a physician. T emporary measures include applying\\nice packs to injured areas, and the use of aspirin or nons-\\nteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS) to reduce pain\\nand swelling. Initial first aid for a fracture may include\\nsplinting, control of blood loss, and monitoring of vital\\nsigns, such as breathing and circulation. Medical treat-\\nment will depend on the location of the fracture, its type\\nand severity , and the individual’s age and general health\\nstatus. If an open fracture is accompanied by serious soft\\ntissue injury , it may be necessary to control bleeding and\\nthe shock that can accompany it.\\nImmobilization of the fracture site can be done inter-\\nnally or externally . The primary goal of immobilization is\\nto maintain the realignment of the bone long enough for\\nhealing to start and progress. Immobilization by external\\nfixation uses splints, casts, or braces; this may be the pri-\\nmary and only procedure for fracture treatment. Splinting\\nto immobilize a fracture can be done with or without trac-\\ntion. In emergency situations, splinting is a useful form of\\nfracture management, if medical care is not immediately\\navailable. It should be done without causing additional\\npain and without moving the bone segments. In a clinical\\nenvironment, plaster of Paris casts are used for immobi-\\nlization. Braces are useful as they often allow movement\\nabove and below the fracture site.\\nOpen reduction is surgery that is usually performed by\\nan orthopedist. It allows the surgeon to examine and cor-\\nrect soft tissue damage while the bones are being reposi-\\ntioned into their normal alignment. Internal fixation de-\\nvices, such as metal screws, plates, and pins, hold the\\nbones in place as they heal. Fragments are often held to-\\ngether with metal rods. Later, the physician may or may\\nnot elect to remove these devices when healing is com-\\nplete. Open reduction is most often used for open, severe,\\nor comminuted fractures. Fractures with little or no dis-\\nplacement of the bones do not usually require such surgery .\\nClosed reduction refers to realigning the bones with-\\nout using surgery . It is accomplished by manually adjust-\\ning the bones or using traction, and often requires the use\\nof an anesthetic. Traction is a form of closed reduction\\nthat works by applying a steady force to the bones,\\npulling on them with weights until the proper alignment\\nis achieved. The traction device can also be used to im-\\nmobilize the affected area while the bone heals. Since\\ntraction restricts movement, this treatment means that\\nthe patient will be confined to bed rest for an extended\\nperiod of time.\\nIn external fixation, pins or screws are attached to\\nthe bone directly above and below the site of the frac-\\nture. They are then connected to a device of metal bars\\nfixed over the skin. These act as a frame, keeping the\\nbones aligned so they can heal properly . With any type of\\ntreatment for a fracture, muscle and joint strength and\\nflexibility should be maintained through proper exercises\\ndone as the bone tissue heals.\\nHealing time for fractures varies from person to person,\\nwith the elderly generally needing more time to heal com-\\npletely . Recovery is complete when there is no bone motion\\nat the fracture site, and x rays indicate complete healing.\\nExpected results\\nFractures can normally be cured with proper first aid\\nand after care. Proper realignment of the bones is much\\nmore difficult if the break has occurred more than six\\nhours in the past.

It was\\nused in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome to treat a vari-\\nety of skin problems and digestive disorders.\\nFrom the standpoint of mineralogy , French green clay\\nbelongs to a subcategory of clay minerals known as illite\\nclays, the other two major groups being kaolinite and\\nsmectite clays. Clay minerals in general are important be-\\ncause they make up about 40 percent of such common\\nrocks as shale, and they are the main components of soil.\\nIllite clays are usually formed by weathering or by\\nchanges produced in aluminum-rich minerals by heat and\\nacidic ground water. They often occur intermixed with\\nkaolinite clays—which are typically used in the ceramics\\nindustry . Illite clays have been used successfully by envi-\\nronmental managers to remove such heavy metals as lead,\\ncadmium, and chromium from industrial wastewater.\\nFrench green clay takes its name from the fact that\\nrock quarries located in southern France enjoyed a virtual\\nmonopoly on its production until similar deposits of illite\\nclays were identified in China, Montana, and W yoming.\\nThe clay’s green color comes from a combination of iron\\noxides and decomposed plant matter, mostly kelp sea-\\nweed and other algae. Grey-green clays are considered\\nless valuable than those with a brighter color. The other\\ncomponents of French green clay include a mineral\\nknown as montmorillonite, as well as dolomite, magne-\\nsium, calcium , potassium , manganese , phosphorus ,\\nzinc, aluminum, silicon, copper, selenium, and cobalt.\\nFrench green clay is prepared for the commercial mar-\\nket by a process of sun-drying and crushing. After the clay\\nhas been mined, it is spread in the sun to remove excess\\nwater. It is then ground by large hydraulic crushers and mi-\\ncronized, or finely pulverized. The last stage in the process\\nis a final period of sun-drying to remove the last traces of\\nwater. French green clay is available in a dry powdered\\nform for a variety of uses as well as in premixed soaps,\\nscrubs, facial powders, and masks for cosmetic purposes.\\nPrices for an eight-ounce jar of powdered clay range be-\\ntween $4.50 and $11.00 in health food stores. Soaps made\\nwith French green clay are priced at about $4.50 a bar.\\nGeneral use\\nExternal\\nFrench green clay is most commonly used in the\\nUnited States and Canada for cosmetic purposes, as dis-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2786\\nFrench green clay\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nBone scan —A diagnostic procedure in which ra-\\ndioactive tracer is injected and images are taken\\nof specific areas or the entire skeleton.\\nOsteoporosis—Literally meaning “porous bones,”\\nthis condition occurs when bones lose an exces-\\nsive amount of their protein and mineral content,\\nparticularly calcium.

It is regarded as a useful\\ntreatment for stimulating the skin and removing impuri-\\nties from the epidermis (outermost layer of skin cells).\\nThe clay works by adsorbing impurities from the skin\\ncells, by causing dead cells to slough off, and by stimu-\\nlating the flow of blood to the epidermis. As the clay\\ndries on the skin, it causes the pores to tighten and the\\nskin to feel firm.\\nOther external uses for French green clay include\\npoultices to treat arthritis, sore muscles, and sprains;\\nready-to-use pastes for application to cuts,bruises, insect\\nbites, stings, and minor burns; and mineral baths for\\nstress relief. Some practitioners maintain that the plant\\nmatter in French green clay has anti-inflammatory as well\\nas antiseptic or bactericidal properties. It is interesting that\\na group of Italian researchers reported in 2002 that French\\ngreen clay powder is as effective as salicylic sugar powder\\nin preventing infection of the umbilical stump in new-\\nborns. The clay powder was found to be superior to pow-\\nders containing colloidal silver, antibiotics, or fuchsine.\\nInternal\\nInternal uses of French green clay are more popular\\nin Europe than in North America, although some Ameri-\\ncan alternative healers recommend drinking or gargling\\nwith solutions of French green clay to cleanse the diges-\\ntive tract, treat nausea or other gastric disorders, ease\\nmenstrual cramps, or relieve sore throats. It is claimed\\nthat French green clay absorbs toxins from the stomach\\nand intestines as well as neutralizing radioactivity in the\\nbody . A French naturopath states that the copper in the\\nclay fights infections , the cobalt helps to prevent ane-\\nmia, the selenium aids liver function and slows down the\\naging process, and the other minerals restore the body’s\\noverall equilibrium.\\nPreparations\\nExternal\\nFacial masks: Commercial prepackaged clay masks\\nare generally spread on the face directly from the jar or\\ntube, care being taken to avoid the eye area. After the\\nclay dries—usually about 10–15 minutes— the mask is\\nwashed off with warm running water. T o make a facial\\nmask from powdered clay , combine 1/2 to 1 tbsp of the\\npowder with 1–2 tbsp of water and apply to the skin;\\nrinse with warm water after 10 minutes. Some users add\\na few drops of aloe vera gel to the clay mixture. A recipe\\nfor a facial mask for oily skin consists of mixing 1 tbsp\\nof powdered clay with 5 drops of jojoba oil.\\nA recipe for a “gourmet spa facial mask” calls for\\nmixing 1/4-cup of French green clay powder with 1/4-\\ncup water. After the clay and water have been well\\nblended, 2 tbsp of honey and 1/4-cup of mashed banana\\nor avocado are added to the mixture. The mask is applied\\nto the face, allowed to remain for 10 min, and rinsed off\\nwith warm water.\\nDeodorizing foot treatment: A half-cup of powdered\\nFrench green clay is mixed with 1/2-cup of water and\\n2–3 drops of tea tree essential oil. The mixture is applied\\nto the feet, covered loosely with plastic wrap, and rinsed\\noff after 15 min with cool water. The feet may then be\\nrubbed with a moisturizing cream.\\nPoultice: One poultice recipe calls for mixing several\\ntablespoons of powdered clay with enough water to form\\na thick paste and allowing it to stand in a glass bowl for\\ntwo hours. The paste is then applied in a layer about 1/4-\\nin thick to a piece of gauze. The poultice is applied to the\\ninjured area with the gauze uppermost and held in place\\nwith adhesive tape. It can be left in place as long as two\\nhours, but the clay should not be allowed to dry . Up to 6\\ndrops of essential oil of lavender , Roman chamomile ,\\nginger, or rosemary may be added if desired. Poultices\\nshould not be reused but discarded after use.\\nMineral bath: A half-cup of powdered French green\\nclay can be added to a tub of warm water to soothe sun-\\nburned or irritated skin, or relieve arthritis or muscle pains.\\nInternal\\nT o cleanse the digestive system, mix 1 tsp of pow-\\ndered clay in an 8–10-ounce glass of mineral water and\\nallow to stand overnight. The mixture may be taken the\\nnext morning either as the clear liquid that has risen to\\nthe top or after stirring to recombine the clay and water.\\nIt is to be taken every morning for 21 days. The treat-\\nment should not be repeated until a week after the last\\ndose. The clay mixture can also be used to relieve men-\\nstrual cramps; it is taken each morning during the first\\nthree weeks of the woman’s cycle. After the flow begins,\\na warm clay poultice can be applied to the abdomen in\\nthe morning and evening.\\nA recipe for a sore throat gargle consists of 1–2 tsp\\nof clay added to a glass of salt water with 1–2 drops of\\nessential oil of rosemary or lavender. The gargle can be\\nused several times a day until the symptoms are relieved.\\nA European regimen for treating hemorrhoids con-\\nsists of drinking three glasses of powdered clay in water\\neach day for three weeks, alternating with three weeks\\nwithout the mixture over a total period of three months.\\nThe clay-and-mineral water mixture can also be com-\\nbined with tinctures of Indian vine and witch hazel .

A peren-\\nnial temperate herb, it grows in mountain slope and sub-\\nalpine meadows, usually on open, stony , and moist hill-\\nsides. In the W est, fritillaria is most commonly regarded\\nas an ornamental garden plant. By contrast, it is tradi-\\ntionally valued as an herbal remedy in Nepal and China,\\nwhere it grows in the Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Xizang,\\nand Y unnan provinces. T wo related species,F . thunbergii\\nand F . hupehensis, are also used medicinally , and in\\nsome regions, F . unibracteata, F . przewalski, and F.\\ndelavayi are used as botanical substitutes.\\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, fritillaria is called\\nchuan bei mu which translates as “Shell mother from\\nSichuan. ” English common names include fritillary , ten-\\ndrilled fritillary bulb, and Sichuan fritillary bulb. Its\\npharmaceutical name, used to distinguish it as a medi-\\ncine, is Bulbus Fritillariae Cirrhosae and it is one of\\nmore than 500 plants recognized as official drugs in tra-\\nditional Chinese medicine.\\nGeneral use\\nPractitioners of Chinese medicine believe that fritil-\\nlaria affects the heart and lung meridians, or energy path-\\nways in the body , and use it primarily to treat various\\nlung conditions, including asthma, bronchitis, tubercu-\\nlosis, and coughs of any type. In the traditional Chinese\\nmedical system, the white color of fritillaria is thought to\\nindicate its usefulness for ailments of the lungs, which\\nare associated with the color white. Fritillaria’s medicinal\\nproperties are considered bitter, sweet, and mildly cold.\\nFritillaria is used for many types of cough, particu-\\nlarly chronic cough, cough associated with difficult ex-\\npectoration, and cough with blood-streaked sputum. Chi-\\nnese practitioners prescribe it to moisten dry mucous\\nmembranes, resolve phlegm, and control coughing. It is\\nthought to be most effective for coughs accompanied by\\nreduced appetite and a stifling sensation in the chest and\\nupper abdomen, symptoms that indicate suppressed qi,\\nor vital energy .\\nFritillaria’s secondary use is as a lymphatic decon-\\ngestant to reduce swellings, nodules, fibrocystic breasts,\\ngoiter, and swollen lymph glands. In China, it also is\\nused for thyroid and lung cancer.\\nResearch on F . cirrhosa and its botanical relatives\\nhas generally been conducted in China and has focused\\non pharmacological investigation. These studies show\\nthat F . cirrhosa and other related species contain com-\\npounds that have antitussive and expectorant activity be-\\ncause they inhibit contraction of bronchial smooth mus-\\ncle and decrease secretion of mucus. Compounds re-\\nsponsible for this activity , as defined in W estern chem-\\nistry , include several bioactive isosteroidal alkaloids\\n(verticine, verticinone, isoverticine, imperialine, hupehe-\\nnine, ebeiedine, ebeienine, and ebeiedinone) and two nu-\\ncleosides (thymidine and adenosine). The discovery of a\\nnew diterpenoid ester in fritillaria was reported in 2002.\\nAnimal research has also demonstrated central ner-\\nvous-system inhibition, including prolonged decrease in\\nblood pressure, stimulation of the heart muscle, and dys-\\nfunction of breathing.\\nPreparations\\nFritillaria is not generally available in American\\nhealth food stores but processed forms are available at\\nChinese pharmacies and Asian groceries. Chinese patent\\nmedicines containing fritillaria can be purchased over\\nthe Internet; typical prices are $13–$15 for a 4-oz bottle.\\nAs medicine, fritillaria is graded into four categories,\\nbased on shape and the location in which it was grown:\\nsong-pei, lu-pei, ching-pei, and ming-pei . Because the\\nraw bulb is toxic, all medicinal forms are processed.\\nGood quality processed powder is white and has a fine\\nconsistency . Small, white, lobed bulbs that have been\\nboiled or steamed and dried also may be available.\\nThe standard dose ranges from 3–12 grams daily as\\na decoction (strong tea) or 1–1.5 grams as powder. Pills\\nin equivalent doses are also available, and the herb also\\nmay be applied externally as either a powder or cream.\\nPractitioners of Chinese medicine commonly com-\\nbine fritillaria in patent formulas along with other Chi-\\nnese herbs such as ma huang ( Ephedra sinica ) and bal-\\nlanflower ( Platycodon grandiflorum ).

(Photo Researchers, Inc. Repro-\\nduced by permission.)\\nFrostbite and frostnip\\nDefinition\\nFrostbite is localized tissue injury that occurs because\\nof exposure to freezing or near freezing temperatures. Frost-\\nnip is a milder cold injury that does not cause tissue loss.\\nDescription\\nIn North America, frostbite is largely confined to\\nAlaska, Canada, and the northern states. In recent years,\\nthere has been a substantial decline in the number of\\ncases. This is probably for several reasons, including bet-\\nter winter clothing and footwear and greater public un-\\nderstanding of how to avoid cold-weather dangers. At the\\nsame time, the nature of the at-risk population has\\nchanged. Rising numbers of homeless people have made\\nfrostbite an urban as well as a rural public health con-\\ncern. The growing popularity of outdoor winter activities\\nhas also expanded the at-risk population.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nFrostbite\\nSkin exposed to temperatures a little below the\\nfreezing mark can take hours to freeze, but very cold\\nskin can freeze in minutes or seconds. Air temperature,\\nwind speed, and moisture all affect how cold the skin be-\\ncomes. A strong wind can lower skin temperature con-\\nsiderably by dispersing the thin protective layer of warm\\nair that surrounds our bodies. W et clothing readily draws\\nheat away from the skin. The evaporation of moisture on\\nthe skin also produces cooling. For these reasons, wet\\nskin or clothing on a windy day can lead to frostbite even\\nif the air temperature is above the freezing mark.\\nThe extent of permanent injury , however, is deter-\\nmined more by the length of time the skin is frozen than\\nby how cold the skin and the underlying tissues become.\\nThus, homeless people and others whose self-preservation\\ninstincts may be clouded by alcohol or psychiatric illness\\nface a greater risk of frostbite-related amputation. They\\nare more likely to stay out in the cold when prudence dic-\\ntates seeking shelter or medical attention. Alcohol also af-\\nfects blood circulation in the extremities in a way that can\\nincrease the severity of injury , as does smoking. A review\\nof 125 Saskatchewan frostbite cases found a tie to alcohol\\nin 46% and to psychiatric illness in 17%. Driving in poor\\nweather can also be dangerous: vehicular failure was a\\npredisposing factor in 15% of the Saskatchewan cases.\\nFrostbite is classified by degree of injury (first, sec-\\nond, third, or fourth), or simply divided into two types,\\nsuperficial (corresponding to first- or second-degree in-\\njury) and deep (corresponding to third- or fourth-degree\\ninjury). Most frostbite injuries affect the feet or hands.\\nThe remaining 10% of cases typically involve the ears,\\nnose, cheeks, or penis. Once frostbite sets in, the affected\\npart begins to feel cold and, usually , numb; this is fol-\\nlowed by a feeling of clumsiness. The skin turns white or\\nyellowish. Many patients experience severe pain in the\\naffected part during rewarming treatment and an intense\\nthrobbing pain that arises two or three days later and can\\nlast days or weeks. As the skin begins to thaw during\\ntreatment, edema often occurs, causing swelling in the\\narea. In second- and higher-degree frostbite, blisters ap-\\npear. Third-degree cases produce deep, blood-filled blis-\\nters and, during the second week, a hard black eschar\\n(scab). Fourth-degree frostbite penetrates below the skin\\nto the muscles, tendons, nerves, and bones. In severe\\ncases of frostbite, the dead tissue can mummify and drop\\noff. Affected areas are also more prone to infection.\\nFrostnip\\nLike frostbite, frostnip is associated with ice crystal\\nformation in the tissues, but no tissue destruction occurs\\nand the crystals dissolve as soon as the skin is warmed.\\nFrostnip affects areas such as the earlobes, cheeks, nose,\\nfingers, and toes. The skin turns pale and numb or tingly\\nuntil warming begins.\\nDiagnosis\\nFrostbite diagnosis relies on a physical examination\\nand may also include conventional radiography (x rays),\\nangiography (x-ray examination of the blood vessels using\\nan injected dye to provide contrast), thermography (use of\\na heat-sensitive device for measuring blood flow), and\\nother techniques for predicting the course of injury and\\nidentifying tissue that requires surgical removal. During\\nthe initial treatment period, however, severity is difficult to\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 791'),\n",

Diagnostic tests only become useful 3-5 days after\\nrewarming, once the blood vessels have stabilized.\\nT reatment\\nMechanical treatment\\nFrostnipped fingers are helped by blowing warm air\\non them or holding them under one’s armpits. Other\\nfrostnipped areas can be covered with warm hands. The\\ninjured areas should never be rubbed.\\nBy contrast, emergency medical help should always be\\nsought whenever frostbite is suspected. While waiting for\\nhelp to arrive, one should, if possible, remove wet or tight\\nclothing and put on dry , loose clothing or wraps. A splint\\nand padding are used to protect the injured area. Rubbing\\nthe area with snow or anything else is dangerous. The key\\nto prehospital treatment is to avoid partial thawing and re-\\nfreezing, which releases more mediators of inflammation\\nand makes the injury substantially worse. For this reason,\\nthe affected part must be kept away from heat sources such\\nas campfires and car heaters. Experts advise rewarming in\\nthe field only when emergency help will take more than two\\nhours to arrive and refreezing can be prevented.\\nBecause the outcome of a frostbite injury cannot be\\npredicted at first, all hospital treatment follows the same\\nroute. Treatment begins by rewarming the affected part\\nfor 15-30 minutes in water at a temperature of 104-108°F\\n(40-42.2°C). This rapid rewarming halts ice crystal for-\\nmation and dilates narrowed blood vessels. Aloe vera\\n(which acts against inflammatory mediators) is applied to\\nthe affected part, which is then splinted, elevated, and\\nwrapped in a dressing. Milky blisters are debrided\\n(cleaned by removing foreign material), and hemorrhagic\\n(blood-filled) blisters are simply covered with aloe vera.\\nHydrotherapy\\nAlternative practitioners suggest several kinds of\\ntreatment to speed recovery from frostbite after leaving\\nthe hospital. Bathing the affected part in warm water or\\nusing contrast hydrotherapy can enhance circulation.\\nContrast hydrotherapy involves a series of hot and cold\\nwater applications. A hot compress (as hot as the patient\\ncan stand) is applied to the affected area for three min-\\nutes followed by an ice-cold compress for 30 seconds.\\nThese applications are repeated three times each, ending\\nwith the cold compress. For patients who have been hos-\\npitalized with frostbite, hydrotherapy should only be per-\\nformed after checking with a physician to ensure it is\\ndone correctly and does not aggravate the condition.\\nHomeopathy\\nHomeopathic Hypericum (Hypericum perforatum )\\nis recommended when nerve endings are affected (espe-\\ncially in the fingers and toes) and Arnica (Arnica mon-\\ntana) is prescribed for shock and if there is accompany-\\ning blunt trauma to the frostbitten area.\\nNutritional supplements\\nCayenne pepper ( Capsicum frutescens ) can en-\\nhance circulation and relieve pain. Drinking hot ginger\\n(Zingiber officinale) tea also aids circulation.\\nOther complementary therapies\\nOther possible approaches include acupuncture to\\navoid permanent nerve damage and oxygen therapy .\\nAllopathic treatment\\nIn addition to the necessary rewarming and debride-\\nment described above, a tetanus shot and antibiotics\\nmay be used to prevent infection. The patient is given\\nibuprofen to combat inflammation. Narcotics are needed\\nin most cases to reduce the excruciating pain that occurs\\nas sensation returns during rewarming. Except when in-\\njury is minimal, treatment generally requires a hospital\\nstay of several days, during which hydrotherapy and\\nphysical therapy are used to restore the affected part to\\nhealth. Experts recommend a cautious approach to tissue\\nremoval, and advise that 22–45 days must pass before a\\ndecision on amputation can safely be made.\\nExpected results\\nThe rapid rewarming approach to frostbite treatment,\\npioneered in the 1980s, has proved to be much more ef-\\nfective than older methods in preventing tissue loss and\\namputation. The extreme, throbbing pain that many frost-\\nbite sufferers endure for days or weeks after rewarming is\\nnot the only prolonged symptom of frostbite. During the\\nfirst weeks or months, people often experience tingling, a\\nburning sensation, or a sensation resembling shocks from\\nan electric current. Other possible consequences of frost-\\nbite include changes of skin color, nail deformation or\\nloss, joint stiffness and pain, hyperhidrosis (excessive\\nsweating), and heightened sensitivity to cold. For every-\\none, a degree of sensory loss lasting at least four years—\\nand sometimes a lifetime—is inevitable.\\nPrevention\\nWith the appropriate knowledge and precautions,\\nfrostbite can be prevented even in the coldest and most\\nchallenging environments. Appropriate clothing and\\nfootwear are essential. T o prevent heat loss and keep the\\nblood circulating properly , clothing should be worn\\nloosely and in layers.

Fungal in-\\nfections of the skin are often called ringworm or tinea.\\nDescription\\nMicroscopic fungi, which are called dermatophytes,\\noften live exclusively on such dead body tissues as hair,\\nthe outer layer of the skin, and the nails. The fungus\\ngrows best in moist, damp, dark places with poor venti-\\nlation and on skin that is irritated, weakened, or continu-\\nously moist. Superficial fungal infections include tinea\\ncapitis, an infection of the neck and scalp; tinea barbae,\\nalso called barber’s itch, along the beard area in adult\\nmales; tinea corporis on parts of the body , such as the\\narms, shoulders, or face; tinea cruris, or jock itch , in-\\nvolving the groin; tinea pedis, or athlete’s foot ; tinea\\nversicolor; and tinea unguium, or infection of the nails.\\nThe term tinea gladiatorum is sometimes used to de-\\nscribe ringworm infections in atheletes. Tinea gladiato-\\nrum is most common in swimmers, wrestlers, and ath-\\nletes involved in other contact sports. Fungal infections\\nof the skin and nails are very common in children, but\\nthey can affect all age groups.\\nSystemic fungal infections occur when spores are\\ntouched or inhaled, or there is an overgrowth of fungi in\\nor on the body . Such infections are most often a serious\\nproblem in those with suppressed immune systems. Can-\\ndidiasis is a rather common fungal infection. When it oc-\\ncurs in the mouth, it is called thrush. Less often, it occurs\\nin the mucous membranes of other parts of the digestive\\nsystem, or in the vagina, heart valves, urinary tract, eyes,\\nor blood. Other systemic fungal infections include as-\\npergillosis, which mostly affects the lungs and may also\\nspread to the brain and kidneys; blastomycosis, a lung\\ninfection that may spread through the bloodstream; coc-\\ncidioidomycosis, also known as San Joaquin or valley\\nfever; mucormycosis, which can develop into a very se-\\nrious, life-threatening infection; and histoplasmosis.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nFungi are widespread in the environment, so it is not\\nunusual that a certain amount of fungi and their spores end\\nup being inhaled into the lungs or landing on the skin.\\nUnder conditions of moisture, warmth, irritation, or injury ,\\nthese fungi grow rapidly and may cause illness. Superfi-\\ncial fungal infections may be due to an overgrowth of\\nfungi already present, or the infection may be the result of\\ncontact with an infected person or with contaminated sur-\\nfaces, bed sheets, towels, or clothing. Fungal infections\\ncan be spread from one part of the body to another by\\nscratching or touching. Additionally , tinea unguium infec-\\nis also crucial for preventing heat loss. Outer garments\\nneed to be wind and water resistant, and wet clothing\\nand footwear must be replaced as quickly as possible.\\nAlcohol and drugs should be avoided because of their\\nharmful effects on judgment and reasoning. Experts also\\nwarn against alcohol use and smoking in the cold be-\\ncause of the circulatory changes they produce.

This is also\\nthe case in people with endocrine disorders, immune dis-\\neases, and other conditions such as obesity , AIDS , tu-\\nberculosis, major burns, leukemia, and diabetes melli-\\ntus.

A KOH (potassium hydroxide) prep is\\na simple laboratory test to confirm the diagnosis. The\\ntest uses tissue samples treated with a 20% potassium\\nhydroxide solution to detect fungi. Examining the skin\\nwith a W ood’s ultraviolet lamp is another easy and con-\\nvenient method to determine the presence of a fungus.\\nCulture and sensitivity testing can be used if a more de-\\nfinitive diagnosis is required. Systemic fungal infections\\nmay be initially diagnosed from blood tests. Confirma-\\ntion is determined by cultures made from sputum, blood,\\nurine, bone marrow , or infected tissue samples.\\ntions have been linked to the use of methyl methacrylate, a\\nglue used for attaching acrylic fingernails.\\nFungal spores are often present in soil and are like-\\nly to be inhaled when the soil is dug up or otherwise\\ndisturbed.

These\\nherbs can be applied to external fungus as infusions,\\nsalves, powders, or vinegars. Many of them can also be\\ntaken internally as capsules or tinctures. Antifungal\\nherbs can be quite strong, however, and care should be\\ntaken that a given remedy is suitable for internal use.\\nWhen an infusion is used, the affected area should\\nbe washed or soaked in the herbal water for at least 15\\nminutes twice daily . Store-bought or homemade tea bags\\ncan be soaked in water or vinegar for about 10 minutes\\nand then used as a poultice for the same effect. Herbal\\nvinegars make excellent remedies for fungus, as vinegar\\nis in itself antifungal. “Gourmet” vinegars with such an-\\ntifungal ingredients as oregano and garlic are often read-\\nily available at grocery stores. The vinegar can be ap-\\nplied a few times daily with cotton or compresses. In ad-\\ndition, a bentonite clay dusting powder can be useful for\\ndrying out the environment of moist skin in which fun-\\ngus thrives. It works best when mixed with powdered an-\\ntifungal herbs such as myrrh or goldenseal. Dusting\\npowder is especially helpful for athlete’s foot.\\nMany herbs high in essential oils also have antifun-\\ngal action, particularly tea tree ( Melaleuca alternifolia ),\\noregano, lavender (Lavandula officinalis ), Eucalyptus\\nspp., rose geranium ( P elargonium graveolens), pepper-\\nmint (Mentha piperita ), chamomile (Matricaria recuti-\\nta), and myrrh. Peppermint oil is especially helpful in re-\\nlieving the itching associated with many fungal infec-\\ntions. The simplest way to use aromatherapy to fight\\nfungal infections is to add several drops of any single es-\\nsential oil or combination of oils to bathwater. Essential\\noil can also be added to mixtures for soaking or com-\\npresses. T ea tree is the herb most frequently recommend-\\ned for the treatment of superficial fungal infections. As\\nwith all essential oils, the full-strength oil should be di-\\nluted in a carrier. A dilution of tea tree oil can be made\\nby adding the essential oil to a carrier oil. This mixture\\ncan be added directly to the site of a skin infection.\\nA healthy diet should be maintained. Foods that are\\nhigh in yeast, such as beer and wine, breads, and baked\\ngoods should be avoided. Fermented foods and sugary\\nfoods, including honey and fruit juices, should also be\\navoided until symptoms have cleared. Antifungal culi-\\nnary herbs such as garlic, tumeric, oregano, sage, and\\ncinnamon should be used liberally in foods. Y ogurt con-\\ntaining live cultures can be incorporated into the diet to\\nsupply needed gut bacteria, and help reduce digestive in-\\nfections such as candidiasis and thrush. Lactobacillus\\nacidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus can also be\\ntaken directly as supplements.\\nSupplements that can be taken for fungal infections\\ninclude vitamins A, B complex, C, and E. Caprylic acid,\\nan extract of the coconut plant, is also recommended as an\\nantifungal, as well as grapefruit seed extract. Essential\\nfatty acids, contained in evening primrose oil, fish liver\\noil, or flaxseed oil, can help reduce the inflammation of\\nsystemic or superficial fungal infections. A dose of one of\\nthese oils is recommended as a daily supplement.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nSuperficial fungal infections are usually treated with\\nsuch antifungal creams or sprays as tolnaftate (Aftate or\\nTinactin), clotrimazole, miconazole nitrate (Micatin prod-\\nucts), econazole, ketoconazole, ciclopirox, naftifine, itra-\\nconazole, terbinafine, fluconazole, or Whitfield’s tincture\\nmade of salicylic acid and benzoic acid. If the infection is\\nresistant, a doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal drug\\nsuch as ketoconazole or griseofulvin. Drugs used for sys-\\ntemic infections include amphotericin B, which is highly\\ntoxic and is used for severe or life-threatening infections;\\nthe azoles, particularly fluconazole and itraconazole, which\\nhave been found to be the least toxic of these medications;\\nand flucytosine alone or in combination with other antifun-\\ngal medications. Fungal infections that become inflamed\\nmay be treated with a combination antifungal/steroid med-\\nication. Certain infections may require surgery .\\nExpected results\\nInfections usually respond to treatment within several\\nweeks. However, many fungal infections are resistant to\\ntreatment, and it may take an extended time and repeated\\ntreatments to effect a cure. Infections may spread, and sec-\\nondary bacterial infections may develop. Medications for\\nfungal infections are often strong, and their use may cause\\nsuch undesirable side effects as headache, dizziness, nau-\\nsea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.

These crystals can mi-\\ngrate to other parts of the digestive tract, causing severe\\npain and life-threatening complications. Gallstones vary\\nin size and chemical structure. They may be as tiny as a\\ngrain of sand, or as large as a golf ball.\\nDescription\\nGallstones usually develop in adults between the\\nages of 20 and 50. The risk of developing gallstones in-\\ncreases with age. Y oung women are up to six times more\\nlikely to develop gallstones than men in the same age\\ngroup. In patients over 50, however, the condition affects\\nmen and women with equal frequency . Native Americans\\ndevelop gallstones more often than any other segment of\\nthe population, and Mexican Americans have the second\\nhighest incidence of this disease. Gallstones tend to be\\npassed down genetically in families.\\nEighty percent of gallstones are composed of choles-\\nterol. They are formed when the liver produces more cho-\\nlesterol than the digestive juices can liquefy. The remaining\\n20% of gallstones are composed of calcium and an orange-\\nyellow waste product called bilirubin, which gives urine its\\ncharacteristic color and sometimes causes jaundice.\\nPeople who have gallstones may remain without\\nsymptoms for an extended period, especially if the\\nstones remain in the gallbladder. In most cases, medical\\ntreatment is only deemed necessary if the individual is\\nexperiencing symptoms. When symptoms do appear, it is\\nusually because the stones have left the gallbladder and\\nare stuck somewhere else within the biliary system,\\nblocking the flow of bile. If gallstones remain stuck in\\nthe biliary system, there can be damage to the liver, pan-\\ncreas, or the gallbladder itself.\\nGallstones bring on several disorders including:\\n• Cholelithiasis: Gallstones within the gallbladder itself.\\nPain is caused by the contractions of the gallbladder\\naround the stone.\\n• Choledocholithiasis: The presence of gallstones within\\nthe common bile duct, which is the passage between\\nthat empties into the small intestine. Once discovered,\\ncommon duct stones need to be removed in order to\\navoid further problems.\\n• Cholecystitis: A disorder marked by inflammation of the\\ngallbladder. It is usually caused by the passage of a stone\\nfrom the gallbladder into the cystic duct, which connects\\nthe gallbladder to the common bile duct. Cholecystitis\\ncauses painful enlargement of the gallbladder and is re-\\nsponsible for 10–25% of all gallbladder surgery .\\nCauses & symptoms\\nGallstones are caused by an alteration in the chemical\\ncomposition of bile, which is a fluid that helps the body\\nbreak down and absorb fats. It is widely held that a diet\\nhigh in fats and processed foods, and low in fiber and\\nwhole foods, is a strong contributor to gallstone forma-\\ntion. High levels of estrogen, insulin, or cholesterol can in-\\ncrease a person’s risk of developing gallstones. If left un-\\ntreated, the risk of developing anemia is also increased.\\nGallbladder attacks usually follow a meal of rich\\nfoods, typically high in fat. The attacks often occur in the\\nmiddle of the night, sometimes waking the patient with\\nsuch intense pain that the episode ends in a visit to the\\nemergency room. Pain often occurs on the right side of\\nthe body . The pain of a gallbladder attack begins in the\\nabdomen and may radiate to the chest, back, or the area\\nbetween the shoulders. Other symptoms of gallstones in-\\nclude inability to digest fats, low fever, chills and sweat-\\ning, nausea and vomiting , indigestion , gas, belching,\\nand clay-colored bowel movements.\\nPregnancy or the use of birth control pills slow\\ndown gallbladder activity and increase the risk of gall-\\nG\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 797\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 797'),\n",

Generally , a vegetarian diet is protec-\\ntive against the formation of gallstones. Recurrent at-\\ntacks can be diminished by maintaining a healthy weight\\nand a healthy diet.\\nCholeretic herbs encourage the liver to secrete bile.\\nThey help maintain the appropriate chemical composi-\\ntion of bile so that it does not form stones. These herbs\\ninclude:\\n• A tincture of dandelion (T araxacum officinale), 2–6 ml\\nonce daily .\\n• Milk thistle seeds ( Sylibum marianum ), a dose equiva-\\nlent to 70–210 mg of silymarin.\\n• Artichoke leaves ( Cynara scolymus ), 150 mg three\\ntimes per day .\\n• Turmeric ( Curcuma longa ), used as a spice; 150 mg\\nthree times per day .\\nUse of the above herbs cause some possible reac-\\ntions, such as gas, diarrhea, nausea, and indigestion.\\nOther therapeutic approaches that have been found\\nto be helpful in treating gallstones include homeopathy,\\ntraditional Chinese herbal medicine, and acupuncture .\\nKnowledgeable practitioners should be consulted.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nWatchful waiting\\nOne-third of all patients with gallstones never expe-\\nrience a second attack. For this reason, many doctors ad-\\nvise an attitude of “wait and see” after the first episode.\\nChanging the diet or following a sensible weight loss\\nplan may be the only treatments required. A person hav-\\ning only occasional mild gallstone attacks may be able to\\nmanage them by using non-prescription forms of aceta-\\nminophen, such as T ylenol or Anacin. A doctor should\\nbe notified if pain intensifies or lasts for more than three\\nhours; if the fever rises above 101°F (38.3°C); or if the\\nskin or whites of the eyes have a yellowish cast.\\nSurgery\\nSurgical removal of the gallbladder, called cholecys-\\ntectomy , is the most common conventional treatment for\\nrecurrent or worsening gallstone attacks. However,\\nsurgery is unecessary in most cases where the gallstones\\nremain without symptoms. Laparoscopic cholecystecto-\\nmy is the technique most widely used. It has mostly re-\\nstones, as do diabetes, pancreatitis , and celiac disease .\\nThis is due to an individual’s higher levels of cholesterol,\\ninsulin, or estrogen from oral contraceptives. Other fac-\\ntors that may encourage gallstone formation are:\\n• infection\\n• anemia\\n• obesity\\n• intestinal disorders\\n• coronary artery disease\\n• multiple pregnancies\\n• a high-fat, low-fiber diet\\n• smoking\\n• heavy drinking\\n• rapid weight loss\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen gallstones are suspected, blood tests for liver\\nenzyme levels are often given. The levels are usually ele-\\nvated when the stone cannot pass through the cystic duct\\nor bile duct. T est results, taken together with symptom\\nhistory (see above) and a physical exam, are simple and\\nrelatively inexpensive for diagnosing the presence of\\ngallstones. However, ultrasound is the method of choice\\nfor a definite diagnosis. It has a high degree of accuracy ,\\nexcept in diagnosing cholecystitis (a stone in the cystic\\nduct).

How-\\never, the open surgery procedure is still used in about 5%\\nof cases because of various complications.\\nNonsurgical therapy\\nIf surgery is considered inappropriate, gallstones\\ncan be dissolved in 30–40% of patients by taking bile\\nacids in tablet form. Dissolution of gallstones by this\\nmethod may take many months or years depending on\\nthe size. Unfortunately , though, recurrence of stones is\\ncommon after cessation of the medication.\\nLithotripsy uses high-frequency sound waves direct-\\ned through the skin to break up the stones. The process\\ncan be combined with the use of bile acid tablets. How-\\never, lithotripsy requires special equipment and is not al-\\nways readily available.\\nDirect cholangiography can be used to remove gall-\\nstones by contact dissolution. The procedure is used to\\ninsert a catheter to inject medication into the gallbladder.\\nStones are often dissolved within a few hours by this\\nmethod.\\nExpected results\\nForty percent of all patients with gallstones have\\n“silent gallstones” that do not require treatment. If symp-\\ntoms develop, however, medical intervention may be-\\ncome necessary . Gallstone problems requiring treatment\\nmay also develop infections that require antibiotics. In\\nrare instances, severe inflammation can cause the gall-\\nbladder to burst, causing a potentially fatal situation. The\\ngallbladder is not an organ that is required to retain\\nhealth. It can be successfully removed, with no recur-\\nrence of stones. Fat digestion, however, becomes more\\ndifficult after surgery , since the gallbladder is no longer\\nthere to store and release bile as needed.\\nPrevention\\nIt is easier, in general, to prevent gallstones than to\\nreverse the process. The best way to prevent gallstones is\\nto minimize risk factors. Since gallstones seem to devel-\\nop more often in people who are obese, eating a bal-\\nanced diet, exercising, and losing weight may help keep\\ngallstones from forming. In addition, a diet high in di-\\netary fiber and low in fats, especially saturated fats, is\\nrecommended. Processed foods should be replaced by\\ncomplex carbohydrates, such as whole grains.\\nIncreased intake of fluids will dilute the bile and in-\\nhibit gallstone formation.

GLA is the product of the\\nbody’s first biochemical step in the transformation of a\\nmajor essential fatty acid, linolenic acid (LA), into impor-\\ntant prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are essential to the\\nproper functioning of each cell. Every cell’s structure in the\\nhuman body depends on fatty acids formed from GLA.\\nGeneral use\\nEvening primrose oil , very high in GLA, has been\\nused for decades to treat medical conditions. Native\\nAmerican women chewed evening primrose seeds to re-\\nlieve menstrual problems. Evening primrose was also\\nused by Native Americans and early American settlers\\nfrom Europe to treat coughs and stomach problems. In\\nthe 1800s, the leaves of the plant were used to treat sev-\\neral skin conditions.\\nEPO was imported to Europe during the 1600s and\\n1700s, and used to treat gout , rheumatoid arthritis ,\\nheadaches, and skin conditions.\\nIn animal studies gamma-linoleic acid has been\\nshown to reduce certain inflammations and reduce joint\\ntissue injury . Human studies showed similar findings in\\nits anti-inflammatory effects.\\nGLA has also been used as a treatment option for a\\nnumber of conditions, including alcoholism, asthma,a t -\\ntention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), high cho-\\nlesterol, diabetic neuropathy , certain cancers, eczema (a\\nskin inflammation), hypertension (high blood pressure),\\npremenstrual syndrome (PMS), rheumatoid arthritis,\\nand scleroderma (a skin disease.)\\nThere is also research data that indicates GLA in\\ncombination with other measures may help in treating\\npeople with Sjögren’s syndrome— a chronic inflamma-\\ntory disease of the immune system that effects mostly\\nolder women.\\nOther animal studies suggest GLA may enhance\\ncalcium absorption, helping to reduce calcium loss and\\nosteporosis. Osteoporosis is a disease occurring primari-\\nly in women after menopause in which the bones be-\\ncome very porous, break easily , and heal slowly . It may\\nlead to curvature of the spine after vertebrae collapse.\\nAmong the conditions GLA is most often used for are:\\n• Rheumatoid arthritis. GLA has been studied for many\\nyears for its possible effects in treating arthritis and\\nother inflammatory conditions . GLA has been shown\\nto be most promising in treating people with this crip-\\npling condition, due to its anti-inflammatory properties.\\nAt least three studies have shown GLA reduces inflam-\\nmation and joint tissue injury , thereby reducing the\\npain associated with this condition. In one study , GLA\\nreduced the incidence of tender jointsby 36%, and\\nswollen joints by 28%.\\n• ADHD. Studies suggest that GLA may be helpful\\n(combined with other therapies) for helping to alleviate\\nADHD symptoms in children.\\n• Diabetes. Some studies show that GLA can help im-\\nprove nerve function and help reduce peripheral neu-\\nropathy, which causes numbness, tingling, pain, or\\nburning in the feet, legs, and toes and hands, in diabetics.\\n• High cholesterol. Research indicates that high doses of\\nGLA may improve blood lipid levels in people with high\\ncholesterol. A late 1990 study showed that oral intake of\\n2 grams of GLA daily for six weeks lowered total cho-\\nlesterol levels by 13% and triglycerides by 37%.\\n• Skin conditions. A number of studies have been done\\nregarding GLA and eczema with contradicting results.\\nSeveral studies showed GLA relieved the symptoms\\nsuch as itching , redness, and scaling of the skin, to\\nvarying degrees. It has also been shown to be helpful in\\nreducing the symptoms of scleroderma and skin in-\\nflammations, such as dermatitis.\\n• Cancer. Studies have shown GLA effectively killed 40\\ntypes of human cancer cells in vitro without damaging\\nnormal cells This sentence is very misleading and\\nmakes GLA sound like a cure for cancer. Other in vitro\\nor test tube studies have also shown GLA has potential\\nto suppress tumor growth and metastasis, the spreading\\nof cancer from the original site to other parts of the\\nbody . Several studies have shown it may be helpful\\nspecifically in treating pancreatic, bladder, and colon\\ncancer. It has shown promising results as a cancer ther-\\napy when combined with the anticancer drugs tamox-\\nifen and paclitaxol. Research into its effects on cancer\\nare in the earliest stages and there is no evidence that\\nGLA prevents or cures any type of cancer.\\n• Hypertension. Several studies suggest GLA may help\\nreduce blood pressure in some people with hyperten-\\nsion and thereby decrease the risk of heart attacks. Re-\\nsults of these studies are not considered conclusive.\\n• PMS. Studies show GLA is remarkably helpful in treat-\\ning some PMS symptoms.

It is also available as\\nevening primrose oil, borage oil, and black currant seed\\noil. It is also available in multi-nutrient formulas that\\noften contain any combination of fish oil , flax seed oil,\\nomega-6 fatty acids , and essential fatty acids . The\\nusual amount of GLA in these is from 200–400 mil-\\nligrams per capsule. The cost of a bottle of 30 capsules\\nranges from $8 to $15. The concentrations of GLA in\\nthese oils varies and the number of capsules needed de-\\npends on the amount of GLA.\\nPrecautions\\nGamma-linoleic acid should not be used by women\\nwho are pregnant or breastfeeding without consulting a\\nphysician. Hemophiliacs and people who take the blood-\\nthinning drug warfarin (Coumadin) should consult a\\nphysician before taking GLA. It should also not be taken\\nbefore surgery because it may increase bleeding. Persons\\nwith high blood pressure or heart or blood vessel condi-\\ntions should consult a physician before taking GLA.\\nSide effects\\nThere is no evidence that GLA is toxic in daily doses\\nof up to 2.8 grams. There have been no reports of serious\\nside effects by people taking GLA supplements. It is gen-\\nerally well tolerated by most people. Possible minor side\\neffects include upset stomach, diarrhea, soft stool, bloat-\\ning, and gas. Persons who take GLA and experience diffi-\\nculty breathing, chest or throat tightness, chest pain,hives,\\nrash, or itchy or swollen skin may be allergic to it.

Reproduced by permission.)\\nGangrene is referred to as wet, or moist, if a bacterial in-\\nfection is involved. In dry gangrene, there is no infection.\\nDescription\\nGangrene is often characterized by pain followed\\nby numbness. The infection may first go unnoticed, es-\\npecially in the elderly or those individuals with a loss of\\nsensation. The area affected by gangrene may be cold\\nand pale, especially early in the disease. Blisters may be\\napparent and the patient may experience an increased\\nheart rate and profuse sweating. As the tissue dies, the\\nskin begins to darken. The dead tissue gradually sepa-\\nrates and falls away from the healthy tissue.\\nDry gangrene is often seen in advanced cases of dia-\\nbetes and arteriosclerosis. The tissue doesn’t become in-\\nfected, rather it dries out and shrivels over a period of\\nweeks or months. W et gangrene progresses much more\\nrapidly . The affected area becomes swollen and gives off\\na foul smelling discharge. Death may occur within a\\nmatter of hours or days. Fever, rapid heart rate, rapid\\nbreathing, altered mental state, loss of appetite, diar-\\nrhea, vomiting , and vascular collapse may occur as the\\ninfection progresses.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe primary cause of gangrene is often an injury to\\nthe blood vessels, causing either an interruption of blood\\nflow , the introduction of a bacterial infection, or both.\\nSuch injuries may include burns , infected bedsores ,\\nboils, frostbite, compound fractures, deep cuts, or gun-\\nshot wounds. Gangrene can also develop due to the poor\\ncirculation and obstructions in the blood vessels associ-\\nated with abnormal blood clots , torsion of organs, and\\ndiseases such as diabetes, heart disease , and Raynaud’s\\ndisease. Gangrene of the internal organs may be attrib-\\nuted to a ruptured appendix, internal wounds, or the\\ncomplications of surgery .\\nThe bloodstream is the body’s main transport sys-\\ntem. When blood flow is diminished, the flow of the\\noxygen and nutrients needed to keep tissues healthy is\\ngreatly decreased. The white blood cells needed to fight\\ninfection are not readily available. In such an environ-\\nment, invading bacteria thrive and multiply quickly .\\nStreptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. are the most\\ncommon agents of external skin infection.\\nGas gang rene, also called progressive or clostridial\\nmyonecrosis, is a type of moist gangrene most commonly\\ncaused by an infection of Clostridium perfringens, or other\\nspecies that are capable of thriving under conditions where\\nthere is little oxygen. These bacteria produce gases and\\npoisonous toxins as they grow in the tissues. Gas gangrene\\ncauses the death of tissue, the destruction of red blood\\ncells, and the damaging of the walls of the blood vessels\\nand parts of the kidneys. Early symptoms include sweat-\\ning, fear, and anxiety. Gas gangrene is a life-threatening\\ncondition and should receive prompt medical attention.\\nDiagnosis\\nA diagnosis of gangrene will be based on a combi-\\nnation of patient history , a physical examination, blood\\ntest results, and other laboratory findings. A physician\\nwill look for a history of recent trauma, surgery , cancer,\\nor chronic disease. Blood tests will be used to determine\\nwhether infection is present and to determine how much\\nthe infection has spread. A sample of drainage from a\\nwound or obtained through surgery may be tested to\\nidentify the bacteria causing the infection and to aid in\\ndetermining treatment. In the case of gas gangrene, the\\ngas produced by the bacteria may be detected beneath\\nthe skin by pressing into the swollen areas. The crackling\\nsounds of gas bubbles may also be heard in the affected\\narea and the surrounding tissues.\\nX-ray studies and other imaging techniques, such as\\ncomputed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance\\nimaging (MRI), may be helpful in making a diagnosis by\\nshowing evidence of gas accumulation or muscle tissue\\ndeath. These techniques, however, are not sufficient alone\\nto provide an accurate diagnosis of gangrene. Precise di-\\nagnosis often requires surgical exploration of the wound.\\nT reatment\\nChelation therapy is a treatment that uses an intra-\\nvenous solution containing the drug ethylenediamine\\ntetra-acetic acid (EDT A), among other substances. In the\\nbloodstream, EDT A binds and removes toxins and\\nplaque formation on arterial walls. It promotes circula-\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 803'),\n",

Early intervention is necessary , however.\\nOther alternative and complementary treatments are\\nused to treat gangrene. Herbal remedies such as gold-\\nenseal can be applied topically . Biofeedback and hypno-\\nsis can increase blood flow . Diabetics will receive herbal\\nand traditional Chinese medicine remedies and nutri-\\ntional supplements to help prevent gangrene.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nPain medications and large amounts of intravenous\\nantibiotics are given. Prompt surgical removal of infect-\\ned and destroyed tissue is required for healing to take\\nplace. Gas gangrene is often treated with the antitoxin\\nfor clostridium as well. In a number of cases, amputation\\nmay have to be used to keep the infection under control.\\nIn hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy the patient is\\nplaced in a pressurized chamber and receives 100% pure\\noxygen to breathe. This has been shown useful in inhibit-\\ning the production of toxins in gas gangrene and for get-\\nting oxygen quickly to tissues, especially following a\\ncrushing injury that might lead to gangrene. HBO thera-\\npy must be carried out early in the process and used be-\\nfore any surgical removal. The therapy , though useful,\\ndoes have adverse side effects. It requires skilled techni-\\ncians and may not be widely available.\\nExpected results\\nThe outcomes for gangrene are generally favorable if\\nthe infection is recognized and treated early in the progres-\\nsion of the disease. Left untreated, gas gangrene will result\\nin a decrease in blood pressure, kidney failure, and coma.\\nOverall, about 20% of those infected with gas gangrene die\\nfrom the disease, and another 20% require an amputation.\\nGangrene is most dangerous to the elderly , those who are\\nimmuno-compromised, and those who have internal infec-\\ntions and chronic conditions such as diabetes. Individuals\\nsuffering from dry gangrene often have multiple health\\nproblems that complicate recovery and may prove fatal.\\nPrevention\\nInfections and injuries should be thoroughly cleaned\\nand monitored; medical attention should be pursued if\\nsymptoms worsen or remain unresolved. Gastrointestinal\\nwounds should be surgically explored, drained, and repaired.\\nUse of antibiotic therapy prior to and directly following\\nsurgery has been shown to reduce the rates of infection.\\nPatients with diabetes or severe arteriosclerosis should\\ntake particular care of their hands and feet to avoid the de-\\ncreased circulation and unchecked infection that may lead\\nto gangrene. Any injury or infection, however slight, should\\nbe cared for promptly . There should be a focus on proper\\nfoot care, including keeping the feet clean, dry , and warm,\\nwearing well-fitting shoes and not going barefoot. It is im-\\nportant to avoid smoking, since tobacco use constricts the\\nblood vessels of the hands and feet, decreasing circulation.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBunch, Bryan, ed.

It is one of the most popular medicinal\\nmushrooms in China, Japan, and the United States.\\nGanoderma grows on logs or tree stumps. It has a\\nshiny , hard, asymmetrical cap that ranges in color from\\nyellow to black. The cap, spores, and mycelium are all\\nused medicinally . Wild ganoderma is rare in Asia.\\nIn ancient China, ganoderma was so rare and so\\nhighly prized that it was reserved for the emperors and\\ncalled the “Elixir of Life. ” In 1972, Japanese researchers\\nsuccessfully cultivated the mushroom. There are six dif-\\nferent colors of cap: red, green, white, black, yellow , and\\npurple. These researchers showed that all colors are the\\nsame species, and that the color variations are the result\\nof differences in environmental conditions. Despite this,\\nsome herbalists insist that certain colors of reishi mush-\\nroom are more potent or effective in healing certain con-\\nditions than others.\\nGeneral use\\nGanoderma is considered one of the most important\\nherbs in Asian healing. Its use extends to almost every\\nsystem of the body . Not only is it believed to heal physi-\\ncal ailments, it is said to bring about a peaceful state of\\nmind, and to increase spiritual potency energy for T aoists\\nand other Asian spiritual seekers.\\nGanoderma has been used in China for over 4,000\\nyears. It is the primary shen tonic in Chinese herbalism.\\nIn a broad sense, it is used to help a person adapt both\\nphysically and mentally to the world. It is used to\\nstrengthen and calm the nerves, improve memory , and\\nprevent or delay senility .\\nHerbalists consider ganoderma an adaptogen, or nat-\\nural regulator, suppressing the immune system if it is\\noveractive and boosting it if it is underactive. Many health\\nclaims are made on the effect that ganoderma has on the\\nimmune system. These claims are based primarily on the\\npresence of high molecular weight polysaccharides and\\nfree radical antioxidants in ganoderma extracts. Ganoder-\\nma also contains the elements potassium (K), magne-\\nsium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and germanium (Ge).\\nGanoderma is used in Japan and China to treat can-\\ncer and to stimulate the immune system after radiation\\nor chemotherapy . It is also used to treat myasthenia\\ngravis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), both\\nautoimmune diseases. In Japan and China, ganoderma is\\nalso used to treat symptoms of viral diseases such as\\ncolds, influenza, canker sores, and hepatitis.\\nQuite a few research studies on ganoderma extracts\\nhave been done at universities in Japan, China, and\\nSouth Korea. Many of these are test-tube or animal stud-\\nies. The results are not clear-cut, but they seem to indi-\\ncate that at least in these non-human systems, ganoder-\\nma has an effect on the immune system, some anti-tumor\\nproperties, and some anti-viral activity . One group of re-\\nsearchers reported in 2002 that ganoderma appears to\\nprotect the liver from inflammation caused by infection.\\nMore recent research in Asian universities has inves-\\ntigated the effects of ganoderma on human cells or tis-\\nsues. A recent study done in T aiwan indicates that gano-\\nderma inhibits apoptosis (cell self-destruction) in human\\nwhite blood cells. This finding may help to explain gano-\\nderma’s beneficial effects on the immune system.\\nGanoderma has recently attracted the attention of\\nW estern cancer researchers. A case study report from\\nColumbia University indicates that a Japanese dietary\\nsupplement containing ganoderma as well as genistein, a\\nsoybean derivative, may be useful in the prevention and\\ntreatment of prostate cancer.\\nGanoderma is also used in treating conditions of the\\nnervous system. It is used to calm the nerves, cure in-\\nsomnia , reduce stress , eliminate nervous exhaustion,\\nand increase determination and focus. Laboratory studies\\nshow fairly conclusively that ganoderma does act as a\\nsedative on cells of the central nervous system and possi-\\nbly has painkilling and anti-convulsive properties.\\nGanoderma is frequently used to treat allergies, hay\\nfever, bronchial asthma , and to reduce skin inflamma-\\ntion. Laboratory studies support these uses and show that\\nsome components of ganoderma have a strong antihista-\\nminic effect that interrupts the development of allergic\\nreactions.\\nMany conditions of the blood and circulatory sys-\\ntem are treated with ganoderma. These include:\\n• altitude sickness\\n• atherosclerosis\\n• cardiac arrhythmia\\n• coronary heart disease\\n• high blood pressure\\n• high blood sugar\\n• high cholesterol\\n• low blood pressure\\n• stroke\\nScientific research shows that compounds found in\\nganoderma do lower blood sugar and also interfere with\\nthe clotting of blood platelets. This reduction in clotting\\nmay account for ganoderma’s effectiveness against\\nstroke and atherosclerosis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 805\\nGanoderma\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 805'),\n",

Though not native to either North or South\\nAmerica, they were named for an eighteenth-century\\nAmerican physician and naturalist, Alexander Garden.\\nGardenias were originally found only in China and\\nJapan, but today there are over 200 different species of\\ngardenia, mostly hybrid, in existence throughout the\\nworld. Gardenias are most prevalent in China, Japan,\\ntropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific is-\\nlands, and South Africa. With proper conditions, garde-\\nnias grow into shrub-like bushes or small trees that can\\nreach 5 ft (1.5 m) in height.\\nMost species of gardenia, however, are very tender\\nplants that require an average temperature of at least\\n60°F (28.9°C), sunlight with some protection, and just\\nthe right amount of humidity. They often survive far bet-\\nter in greenhouses than outside. Gardenias are often ram-\\nbling plants that form mounds of glossy dark green fo-\\nliage. The leaves are oval in shape and very shiny . The\\nflowers vary in color from pale yellow with purple mark-\\nings to creamy white, and they have a classic, heavy ,\\nsweet scent reminiscent of green apple. All gardenia\\nblossoms have an almost wax-like appearance and can\\nbe either single or double, depending on the species.\\nMost gardenias flower in the winter or early spring, and\\nthe blossom is followed by the appearance of a large,\\nyellowish-red, bitter-tasting berry that contains a crys-\\ntalline compound called acrocetin.\\nThe most commonly listed botanical species of gar-\\ndenia include:\\n• Gardenia jasminoides . This species is easily the most\\ncommon of these rare, fragile plants. It reaches heights\\nof 2 ft (61 cm) and grows into a tall bushy green shrub\\nthat produces white, highly fragrant flowers. G. jasmi-\\nnoides is a native of China, and the gardenia most com-\\nmonly used in Chinese herbal medicine. Its name\\ncomes from the fact that it was first introduced to the\\nW estern world from Cape Colony in Africa, and the\\naroma of its large white flowers was said to be very like\\nthe scent of jasmine.\\n• Gardenia jasminoides fortunata . This plant is a hybrid\\nversion of G. jasminoides that is somewhat more hardy .\\n• Gardenia nitida . This gardenia is a slightly taller plant\\nthat grows up to 3 ft (93 cm) and also produces white\\nblossoms.\\n• Gardenia radicans floreplena . This plant is a low\\nspreading dwarf variety from Japan that grows only to\\nheights of 18 in (46 cm), and has double-blossomed\\nflowers.\\n• Gardenia thunbergia . This gardenia grows to 4 ft (1.2\\nm) and is often cultivated in American greenhouses.

Boston: Shambhala,\\n1993.\\nOTHER\\nDr. Duke’s Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases.\\nhttp://www .ars-grm.gov/cgibm/duke/ethnobot.htm\\nJoan Schonbeck\\nGarlic\\nDescription\\nGarlic ( Allium sativa ), is a plant with long, flat\\ngrasslike leaves and a papery hood around the flowers.\\nThe greenish white or pink flowers are found grouped\\ntogether at the end of a long stalk. The stalk rises directly\\nfrom the flower bulb, which is the part of the plant used\\nas food and medicine. The bulb is made up of many\\nsmaller bulbs covered with a papery skin known as\\ncloves. Although garlic is known as the “stinking rose” it\\nis actually a member of the lily family .\\nThe most active components of fresh garlic are an\\namino acid called alliin and an enzyme called allinase.\\nWhen a clove of garlic is chewed, chopped, bruised, or\\ncut, these compounds mix to form allicin, which is re-\\nsponsible for garlic’s strong smell. Allicin, in turn,\\nbreaks down into other sulfur compounds within a few\\nhours. These compounds have a variety of overlapping\\nhealing properties.\\nGarlic also contains a wide range of trace minerals.\\nThese include copper, iron, zinc, magnesium, germani-\\num, and selenium. The integrity of the growers and sup-\\npliers of garlic are important to the integrity of the garlic\\nused. A soil rich with the presence of trace minerals will\\nproduce a healthful bulb of garlic, full of those minerals.\\nDepleted soils produce a depleted product. In addition,\\ngarlic contains many sulfur compounds, vitamins A and\\nC, and various amino acids.\\nGeneral use\\nThe ancient Indians, Chinese, Egyptians, Greeks,\\nRomans, and other peoples have used garlic for thou-\\nsands of years, as food and as medicine. One of the most\\nfamed usages of garlic was during the Middle Ages,\\nwhen it was reputed to have been highly effective against\\nthe plague.\\nAs early as 1858, Louis Pasteur formally studied\\nand recorded garlic’s antibiotic properties. Dr. Albert\\nSchweitzer used the herb to successfully treat cholera,\\ntyphus, and dysentery in Africa in the 1950s. Before an-\\ntibiotics were widely available, garlic was used as a\\ntreatment for battle wounds during both W orld W ars.\\nGarlic can be used in the treatment of a variety of\\nbacterial, viral, and fungal infections. It has been shown\\nto be effective against staph, strep, E. coli , Salmonella ,\\nV ibrio cholera,H. pylori, Candida albicans, and other mi-\\ncroorganisms. Garlic also helps prevent against heart dis-\\nease and strokes. Current studies show that garlic can im-\\nprove immune function and may even help in the preven-\\ntion of cancer. T o be of benefit in chronic conditions, gar-\\nlic should be used daily over an extended period of time.\\nHeart disease\\nOne of the main causes of heart disease is the\\nbuildup of plaque on the walls of the blood vessels. This\\nplaque is mostly made up of cholesterol and other fatty\\nsubstances found in the blood. When large amounts of\\nplaque get stuck on artery walls, they block the flow of\\nblood and cause blood clots to form. Parts of the artery\\nwall may even be destroyed completely .\\nIn arteriosclerosis, otherwise known as “hardening\\nof the arteries, ” the major arteries may become so stiff\\nand clogged, that the heart cannot get necessary nutrients\\nand oxygen. This usually causes a heart attack . High\\nserum cholesterol levels are a major risk factor for hav-\\ning a heart attack.\\nStudies show that people who eat garlic regularly\\nhave improved serum cholesterol levels.

In addition, low-den-\\nsity lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride levels are de-\\ncreased and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels are in-\\ncreased. This correlates with an overall reduced choles-\\nterol level. These benefits are significant in preventing\\nheart disease as well as strokes. While garlic’s contribu-\\ntion to reducing levels of harmful plaques has been\\nknown for some time, a 2003 study found that garlic also\\nlowered levels of homocysteine, a type of amino acid that\\nis now considered a major risk factor for heart attacks.\\nManufactured garlic supplements appear to be equally as\\nbeneficial as eating the fresh cloves. It takes at least one\\nmonth of using garlic for laboratory results to be seen.\\nHypertension\\nHypertension, or high blood pressure, is also a sig-\\nnificant cause of heart problems. It is one of the leading\\ncauses of disability and death due to stroke, heart attack,\\nheart failure, and kidney failure. Garlic can help reduce\\nblood pressure through the actions of its sulfur com-\\npounds and its ability to reduce the fatty substances,\\nsuch as cholesterol, found in the bloodstream. Use of\\ngarlic also can help normalize low blood pressure.\\nPlatelet aggregation\\nPlatelets clot the blood in order to repair breaks in\\nthe blood vessel walls. When there is an injury , platelets\\nare attracted to the damaged area and become attached to\\nthe wall and to other platelets. Platelet aggregation, as\\nthis process is called, plugs up the break and prevents\\nfurther blood loss while the injury is being repaired. This\\nis a good and necessary part of healing an injury .\\nHowever, if there are serious problems with the\\nheart and blood vessels and there is too much injury and\\nclotting, the vessels may become clogged with platelets.\\nThis can lead to strokes and heart disease. The sulfur\\ncompounds in garlic—particularly ajoene—give the\\nplatelets a slippery quality . They are less able to clump\\ntogether, thus slowing down platelet aggregation. Garlic\\ncan be used effectively in the same way as a daily dose\\nof aspirin to reduce or prevent platelet aggregation over\\nan extended time.\\nCancer\\nStudies have found that garlic blocks the formation\\nof powerful carcinogens, called nitrosamines, which may\\nbe formed during the digestion of food. This may be why\\nin populations where people consume a large amount of\\ngarlic, there is a decreased incidence of all types of can-\\ncer. The antioxidants found in garlic may also con-\\ntribute to this effect by protecting against the cell dam-\\nage by cancer-causing free radicals. Studies show that\\nuse of garlic may also inhibit the growth of a variety of\\ntumors. However, cancer-related studies are not conclu-\\nsive and relate to consumption of raw or cooked garlic,\\nnot garlic supplements.\\nInfectious conditions\\nEating garlic is good for helping the body’s immune\\nsystem resist infections . While garlic is not as strong as\\nmodern antibiotics, it is believed to kill some strains of\\nbacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics. Studies\\nhave shown garlic treats yeast infections, and it can kill\\nmany of the viruses responsible for colds and flu. While\\ndaily consumption of garlic was once highly recom-\\nmended for HIV -positive individuals, the National Insti-\\ntutes of Health (NIH) reported in 2002 that garlic supple-\\nments greatly reduced levels of saquinavir, an HIV pro-\\ntease inhibitor, in patients’ blood. The NIH began cau-\\ntioning patients who used garlic to control cholesterol\\nlevels who also used saquinavir or combination thera-\\npies, since garlic might interfere with their effectiveness.\\nModern doctors have been reconsidering the causes\\nof many diseases. They have discovered that bacteria and\\nviruses may be the cause of sicknesses that were former-\\nly not thought to be caused by infections. This includes\\ngastric ulcers, colitis, and Kaposi’s sarcoma . Garlic\\nmay be useful in treating or preventing these due to its\\nantimicrobial properties.\\nDiabetes\\nGarlic has the ability to lower and help keep blood\\nsugar stable by helping to increase the amount of insulin\\navailable in the bloodstream. This action, together with\\ngarlic’s ability to lower cholesterol and blood pressure,\\nmake it an excellent daily supplement for people with di-\\nabetes. A 2003 report showed that long-term use of garlic\\nhelped improve the blood vessel systems of diabetic rats.\\nOther health conditions\\nGarlic is effective in the treatment of numerous\\nother conditions. For example:\\n• The consumption of 1–3 cloves per day is useful for\\nimmune support and as a preventive against diseases\\nand infection.\\n• W armed garlic oil in the ear canal can be used to treat\\near infections.\\n• Garlic can be used to treat respiratory complaints such\\nas asthma and chronic bronchitis.\\n• Garlic helps increase the body’s ability to handle the\\ndigestion of meat and fats.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2810\\nGarlic\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 810'),\n",

The raw\\ncloves can be directly applied externally .\\nThe suggested dosage for fresh whole garlic is one\\nto three cloves per day . The cloves can be chewed and\\nheld in the mouth or swallowed. Consuming raw garlic\\ncan actually be a pleasure if the herb is crushed or grated\\nand mixed with food or a tablespoon of honey . The\\ndosage for tinctures is 2–4 ml or 15–40 drops taken\\ntwice daily . One tablespoon of the syrup should be taken\\nthree times a day , or as needed to relieve coughing. Gar-\\nlic oil should be slightly warmed, and 1–3 drops should\\nbe put in the affected ear 1–3 times per day .\\nT ablets and capsules are often more convenient to\\nuse than raw garlic, and they are more likely to be toler-\\nated by garlic-sensitive individuals. Garlic pills also min-\\nimize the garlic taste and odor. Manufacturers vary on\\nwhich components of the herb are emphasized.\\nIn general, the following dosages are appropriate,\\nbut product labels also should be consulted:\\n• 400–500 mg of allicin, twice daily\\n• a dose equaling approximately 4,000 mcg of allicin po-\\ntential, once or twice daily\\n• 400–1,200 mg of dried garlic powder\\n• 1,000–7,200 mg of aged garlic\\n• a dose equivalent to 0.03–0.12 ml of garlic oil, three\\ntimes per day\\nManufactured garlic pills come in a variety of\\nforms, and a great deal of controversy continues about\\nwhat type is best. Studying the manufacturers’ literature\\nand other information is important to make a good deci-\\nsion about which preparation to use. The types of garlic\\npreparations include:\\n• garlic oil capsules\\n• encapsulated powdered garlic\\n• odorless garlic pills\\n• allicin-stabilized pills\\n• aged garlic extract\\nUsed externally\\nA poultice can be made using grated or crushed\\nfresh garlic. The herb material should be placed directly\\non the site of injury or eruption, either “as is” or mixed\\nwith enough honey to make a paste. The poultice can be\\nheld in place with a cloth or bandage.\\nA compress of garlic is less messy than a poultice\\nand may be less irritating to the site of the injury . It is\\nmade by wrapping grated or crushed fresh garlic in a sin-\\ngle piece of cheesecloth. As with the poultice, the com-\\npress is placed directly on the affected area.\\nGarlic oil can be made by putting a whole bulb of\\ngrated or finely chopped garlic into a pint jar of olive oil,\\nand letting it sit undisturbed in a warm place, away from\\ndirect sunlight, for at least two weeks. Then it can be\\nstrained and refrigerated. The garlic oil will stay fresh in\\nthe refrigerator for up to two years.\\nA garlic suppository can be used to treat vaginal yeast\\nor mild bacterial infections. A clove of fresh garlic should\\nbe peeled and slightly crushed or bruised. If crushed garlic\\nirritates the vaginal tissue, an alternative that might lessen\\nthe desired antimicrobial effect is to use the whole, un-\\ncrushed garlic clove. The clove should be wrapped in a sin-\\ngle layer of cheesecloth and inserted into the vaginal canal\\novernight for 5-10 days. Dental floss or a length of the\\ncheesecloth can be used to make the suppository easier to\\nretrieve. If the garlic causes a burning sensation, this can be\\neased with the insertion of plain yogurt into the vagina.\\nPrecautions\\nConsumers will find a wide variety of garlic prepa-\\nrations on the market. Therefore, it is important to study\\nmanufacturers’ claims, talk to knowledgeable practition-\\ners, and find out which formulations are most effective\\nfor a given condition.\\nDue to the high concentration of sulfur compounds in\\ngarlic, it should be avoided by those allergic to sulfur.

True gas-\\ntritis comes in several forms and is diagnosed using a\\ncombination of tests. In the 1990s, scientists discovered\\nthat the main cause of most gastritis is infection by a\\nbacterium called Helicobacter pylori.\\nDescription\\nGastritis should not be confused with common symp-\\ntoms of upper abdominal discomfort. It has been associated\\nwith ulcers, particularly peptic ulcers, and in some cases,\\nchronic gastritis can lead to more serious complications.\\nNonerosive H. pylori gastritis\\nUnder current theory , the main cause of true gastritis\\nis H. pylori infection, which is found in an average of 90%\\nof patients with chronic gastritis. H. pylori is a bacterium\\nwhose outer layer is resistant to the normal effects of stom-\\nach acid in breaking down bacteria. The resistance of H.\\npylori means that the bacterium may remain in the stomach\\nfor long periods of times, even years, and eventually cause\\nsymptoms of gastritis or ulcers when other factors are in-\\ntroduced, such as the presence of specific genes or the use\\nof nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Stud-\\nies of the role of H. pylori in the development of gastritis\\nand peptic ulcers have disproved the former belief that\\nstress leads to most stomach and duodenal ulcers. The\\nnewer findings have resulted in improved treatment and re-\\nduction of stomach ulcers. H. pylori is most likely trans-\\nmitted between humans, although the specific routes of\\ntransmission are still under study . Studies were also under-\\nway to determine the role of H. pylori and resulting chron-\\nic gastritis in the development of gastric cancers.\\nErosive and hemorrhagic gastritis\\nAfter H. pylori , the second most common cause of\\nchronic gastritis is the use of NSAIDs. These commonly\\nused pain killers, including aspirin, fenoprofen, ibupro-\\nfen and naproxen, can lead to gastritis and peptic ulcers.\\nOther forms of erosive gastritis are caused by alcohol or\\ncorrosive agents, or by injuries to the stomach tissues\\nfrom the ingestion of foreign bodies.\\nOther forms of gastritis\\nClinicians differ on the classification of the less\\ncommon and specific forms of gastritis, particularly\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2814\\nGastritis\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nHomeopathic —Healthcare practice that uses\\nremedies and treatments that cause similar effects\\nto the symptoms they are intended to treat in an\\neffort to stimulate the natural immune response of\\nthe body .\\nMalabsorption problems —A condition in which\\nthe intestinal tract is not able to absorb adequate\\nnutrients from the food which passes through it\\n(e.g., celiac disease, tropical sprue).\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 814'),\n",

This is the most serious form of\\ngastritis. It usually occurs in critically ill patients, such\\nas those in intensive care. Stress erosions may develop\\nsuddenly as a result of severe trauma or stresses on the\\nstomach lining.\\n• Atrophic gastritis. This form of gastritis results from\\nchronic gastritis. It is characterized by atrophy , or a de-\\ncrease in size and wasting away of the gastric lining.\\nGastric atrophy is the final stage of chronic gastritis\\nand may be a precursor of gastric cancer.\\n• Superficial gastritis. This term is often used to describe\\nthe initial stages of chronic gastritis.\\n• Uncommon specific forms of gastritis include granulo-\\nmatous, eosiniphilic, and lymphocytic gastritis.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nNonerosive H. pylori gastritis\\nH. pylori gastritis is caused by infection from the H.\\npylori bacterium. It is believed that most infection occurs\\nin childhood. Clinicians think that there may be more\\nthan one route for the bacterium. Its prevalence and dis-\\ntribution differs in nations around the world. The pres-\\nence of H. pylori has been detected in 86–99% of pa-\\ntients with chronic superficial gastritis. Physicians are\\nstill learning about the link of H. pylori to chronic gas-\\ntritis and peptic ulcers, since many patients with H. py-\\nlori infection do not develop symptoms or peptic ulcers.\\nH. pylori is also seen in 90–100% of patients with duo-\\ndenal ulcers.\\nThe symptoms of H. pylori gastritis include abdomi-\\nnal pain and reduced acid secretion in the stomach. The\\nmajority of patients with H. pylori infection, however,\\nsuffer no symptoms, even though the infection may lead\\nto ulcers and resulting symptoms. Ulcer symptoms in-\\nclude dull, gnawing pain, often two to three hours after\\nmeals; and pain in the middle of the night when the\\nstomach is empty .\\nErosive and hemorrhagic gastritis\\nThe most common cause of this form of gastritis is\\nthe use of NSAIDs. Other causes may be alcoholism or\\nstress from surgery or critical illness. The role of\\nNSAIDs in development of gastritis and peptic ulcers de-\\npends on the dose level. Although even low doses of as-\\npirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may\\ncause some gastric upset, low doses generally will not\\nlead to gastritis. However, as many as 10–30% of pa-\\ntients on higher and more frequent doses of NSAIDs,\\nsuch as those with chronic arthritis, may develop gastric\\nulcers. Patients with H. pylori already present in the\\nstomach who are treated with NSAIDs are much more\\nsusceptible to ulcers and other gastrointestinal effects of\\nthese pain killers.\\nPatients with erosive gastritis may also show no\\nsymptoms. When symptoms do occur, they may include\\nanorexia nervosa, gastric pain, nausea, and vomiting.\\nOther forms of gastritis\\nLess common forms of gastritis may result from a\\nnumber of generalized diseases or from complications of\\nchronic gastritis. Any number of mechanisms may cause\\nvarious less common forms of gastritis and they may dif-\\nfer slightly in their symptoms and clinical signs. Howev-\\ner, they all have inflammation of the gastric mucosa in\\ncommon. Research recently found that severe gastritis\\nmay occur rarely as a result of infectious mononuc-\\nleosis.\\nDiagnosis\\nNonerosive H. pylori gastritis\\nH. pylori gastritis is easily diagnosed through the\\nuse of the urea breath test. This test detects active pres-\\nence of H. pylori infection. Other serological tests,\\nwhich may be readily available in a physician’s office,\\nmay be used to detect H. pylori infection. Newly devel-\\noped versions offer rapid diagnosis. New stool antigen\\ntests were developed and made available in 2002. The\\nchoice of test will depend on cost, availability and the\\nphysician’s experience, since nearly all of the available\\ntests have an accuracy rate of 90% or better. Endoscopy ,\\nor the examination of the stomach area using a hollow\\ntube inserted through the mouth, may be ordered to con-\\nfirm the diagnosis. A biopsy of the gastric lining also\\nmay be ordered.\\nErosive or hemorrhagic gastritis\\nThe patient’s clinical history may be particularly im-\\nportant in the diagnosis of this type of gastritis, since its\\ncause is most often the result of chronic use of NSAIDs,\\nalcoholism, or abuse of other substances.\\nOther forms of gastritis\\nGastritis that has developed to the stage of duodenal\\nor gastric ulcers usually requires endoscopy for diagno-\\nsis. It allows the physician to perform a biopsy for possi-\\nble malignancy and for H. pylori .

Licorice is a traditional remedy for stomach\\ninflammation. It also appears to inhibit the growth of\\nH. pylori . People who gain water weight or develop\\nhigh blood pressure as side effects of taking licorice\\ncan be treated with licorice that has had the gly-\\ncyrrhizin removed.\\n• Goldenseal. This herb contains berberine, a compound\\nwith antibiotic properties. There is some evidence that\\nberberine is active against H. pylori.\\n• Chamomile . Chamomile contains apigenin, a\\nbioflavonoid that inhibits H. pylori, and chamazulene, a\\ncompound that counteracts free radicals.\\n• Marsh mallow and slippery elm . These herbs have\\ndemulcent properties, which means that they soothe ir-\\nritated mucous membranes.\\n• Echinacea and geranium. These herbs are recommend-\\ned by some practitioners for their antiseptic and anal-\\ngesic (pain-relieving) properties.\\nNaturopathic practitioners also advise patients with\\ngastritis to eat certain categories of food separately . Pa-\\ntients are advised to eat protein foods by themselves or\\nwith green leafy vegetables; to eat fruits alone; and to\\navoid combining proteins and starches.\\nAcupuncture/acupressure\\nOne source recommends applying gentle pressure to\\na point on the abdomen known as CV (conception ves-\\nsel) 12, midway between the navel and the breastbone.\\nPressure should be applied when the stomach is empty .\\nTrained acupuncturists treat stomach problems by releas-\\ning energy from the spleen and from other energy points\\nassociated with digestion.\\nYoga\\nThe Bow Pose is recommended by some teachers of\\nyoga for stomach disorders because it puts pressure on a\\nnumber of acupoints on the abdomen associated with the\\ndigestive process and with the stomach meridian.\\nChinese herbal medicine\\nThe Chinese traditionally use a tea made from gin-\\nger (Zingiber officinale ) as a stomachic, to improve di-\\ngestive functions.\\nReflexology\\nA trained reflexologist will gently massage the\\nstomach reflexes located on the hands and feet.

The treatment, however, may be\\nuncomfortable for patients and relies heavily on patient\\ncompliance. No single antibiotic has been found that\\nwould eliminate H. pylori on its own, so various combi-\\nnations of antibiotics have been prescribed to treat the\\ninfection.\\nTRIPLE THERAPY . As of early 1998, triple therapy\\nwas the preferred treatment for patients with H. pylori\\ngastritis. This treatment regimen usually involves a two-\\nweek course of three drugs. An antibiotic such as amoxi-\\ncillin or tetracycline, and another antibiotic such as clar-\\nithromycin or metronidazole are used in combination\\nwith bismuth subsalicylate, a substance that helps protect\\nthe lining of the stomach from acid. However, this treat-\\nment often fails due to poor patient compliance and\\nquadruple therapy is required.\\nDUAL THERAPY .Dual therapy involves the use of an\\nantibiotic and a proton pump inhibitor. Proton pump in-\\nhibitors help reduce stomach acid by halting the mecha-\\nnism that pumps acid into the stomach. Dual therapy has\\nnot been proven to be as effective as triple therapy , but\\nmay be ordered for some patients who can more com-\\nfortably handle the use of fewer drugs.\\nOTHER TREATMENTS. Scientists have experimented\\nwith quadruple therapy , which adds an antisecretory drug,\\nor one that suppresses gastric secretion, to the standard\\ntriple therapy . One study showed this therapy to be effective\\nwith only a week’s course of treatment in more than 90% of\\npatients. The goal is to develop the most effective therapy\\ncombination that can work in one week of treatment or less.\\nT reatment of erosive gastritis\\nPatients with erosive gastritis may be given treat-\\nments similar to those for H. pylori , especially since\\nsome studies have demonstrated a link between H. pylori\\nand NSAIDs in causing ulcers. The patient will most\\nlikely be advised to avoid NSAIDs.\\nOther forms of gastritis\\nSpecific treatment will depend on the cause and type\\nof gastritis. These may include prednisone or antibiotics.\\nCritically ill patients at high risk for bleeding may be\\ntreated with preventive drugs to reduce the risk of acute\\nstress gastritis. Sometimes surgery is recommended, but\\nis weighed against the possibility of surgical complica-\\ntions or death. Once heavy bleeding occurs in acute\\nstress gastritis, mortality is as high as 60%.\\nExpected results\\nThe results expected from alternative treatments for\\ngastritis include accelerated healing from some of the di-\\netary therapies, and some symptomatic relief from acu-\\npressure, yoga, and reflexology.\\nThe discovery of H. pylori has improved the progno-\\nsis for patients with gastritis and ulcers. Since treatment\\nexists to eradicate the infection, recurrence is much less\\ncommon. The prognosis for patients with acute stress\\ngastritis is much poorer, with a 60% or higher mortality\\nrate among those bleeding heavily . Recent studies have\\nshown that infection with H. pylori and resulting gastritis\\nmay lead to such complications as chronic gastritis or as\\nserious as gastric adenoma, a form of stomach cancer.\\nPrevention\\nThe widespread detection and treatment of H. pylori\\nas a preventive measure in gastritis has been discussed\\nbut not resolved. Until more is known about the routes\\nthrough which H.pylori is spread, specific prevention\\nrecommendations are not available. It was estimated in\\nlate 2002 that the organism was present in 80% of mid-\\ndle-aged adults in developing countries and about 20%\\nof those in industrialized countries. Erosive gastritis\\nfrom NSAIDs can be prevented with cessation of use of\\nthese drugs. An education campaign was launched in\\n1998 to educate patients, particularly an aging popula-\\ntion of arthritis sufferers, about the risk of developing ul-\\ncers from NSAIDs and alternative drugs.\\nResources\\nBOOK\\nBurton Goldberg Group.

Frey , PhD\\nT eresa G. Odle\\nGastrodia\\nDescription\\nGastrodia is a preparation made from the rhizome or\\ntuber of an orchid, Gastrodia elata. It is a member of the\\nOrchidaceae family . Gastrodia elata is a native of the\\nFar East; its natural areas of distribution include Tibet,\\nwestern China, Korea, and Japan. While gastrodia ap-\\npears in the oldest lists of Chinese medicinal herbs, it\\nwas not known to W estern herbalists.\\nGastrodia is first mentioned in the Shennong Bencao\\nJing, which was compiled around \\nA.D. 100. A later Chi-\\nnese herbalist named T ao Hong placed gastrodia in the\\ncategory of superior herbs, which meant that it could be\\ntaken for long periods of time, and that it could be used\\nto promote longevity as well as to treat illnesses. It was\\noriginally called chiqian , which means “red arrow” in\\nChinese, because its stem is red and arrow-shaped. Later\\nit was named tian ma, or “heavenly hemp, ” which is the\\nname that it still bears in Chinese herbal formularies.\\nLike other wild orchids, Gastrodia elata has been\\nplaced on the list of endangered species. The increasing\\ndifficulty of finding wild gastrodia in the 1970s led to an\\ninteresting discovery about this plant. Chinese herbalists\\ntried to cultivate gastrodia, but failed until biologists dis-\\ncovered that the plant needs two fungi in order to survive\\nand reproduce. It needs the Armillaria mellea mushroom\\non its tuber in order to grow and mature; and it requires a\\nsecond fungus called Mycena osmundicola to help its\\nseeds to sprout. After this complicated relationship was\\nunderstood, herbalists were able to grow gastrodia.\\nAnother aspect of this discovery was the finding that\\nmost of the medicinal benefits associated with gastrodia\\nare actually produced by the Armillaria mushroom.\\nMany growers then decided to cultivate the mushroom\\nby itself without the gastrodia tuber. Some herbalists\\nnow use the Armillaria mushroom in their preparations\\ninstead of wild or cultivated gastrodia.\\nGeneral use\\nIn the categories of Chinese herbal medicine, gastro-\\ndia is classified as having a sweet and slightly warm na-\\nture with a neutral taste. Its traditional uses are to calm\\nthe liver and to clear the meridians by invigorating the\\npatient’s circulation. In the categories of W estern medi-\\ncine, gastrodia is said to have sedative and analgesic\\nproperties. The specific conditions that were treated by\\ngastrodia include migraine headaches, dizziness or verti-\\ngo due to liver inflammations, convulsions caused by\\nheat excess, paralysis, general fatigue , numbness in the\\nhands or feet, and pain in the joints. More recently , gas-\\ntrodia has been used to relieve nervous headaches, pain\\nin the trigeminal nerve, nocturnal emissions, difficult\\nbreathing, insomnia due to stress, and hypertension.\\nChemical analysis of gastrodia indicates that it con-\\ntains significant amounts of calcium , magnesium , and\\npotassium . Its active ingredients include gastrodioside,\\nvanillin (from the rhizome), and vanillyl alcohol (from\\nthe tuber). These last two compounds are related to\\nvanilla flavoring, which comes from another orchid\\ncalled V anilla plantifolia . Research indicates that\\nvanillin has anticonvulsive properties. Other research\\nsuggests that the gastrodia tuber has analgesic and seda-\\ntive effects because the compounds in it decrease the\\nlevel of dopamine in the brain. Most of the other tradi-\\ntional Chinese uses for gastrodia have not been corrobo-\\nrated by research.\\nPreparations\\nSingle-herb preparations\\nGastrodia preparations are made from the tubers and\\nrhizomes, or underground stems, of the plant.

Frey , PhD\\nGastroenteritis\\nDefinition\\nGastroenteritis is a general term for infection or irri-\\ntation of the digestive tract, particularly the stomach and\\nintestine. It is frequently referred to as stomach or in-\\ntestinal flu, although the influenza virus does not cause\\nthis illness. Major symptoms include nausea, vomiting,\\ndiarrhea , and abdominal cramps. Fever and overall\\nmoved and the rhizomes are cleaned and boiled, or\\nsteamed and baked. They are soaked in water a second\\ntime and sliced. In traditional Chinese herbal medicine,\\ngastrodia is given as a decoction (concentration of herb\\nafter boiling down), in doses of 3–10 g per day .\\nThe Armillaria mushroom that is necessary for the\\ngrowth of the gastrodia tuber has been given the Chinese\\nname of tian ma mihuanjun . It is more potent than the\\ngastrodia tuber because it is the source of the tuber’s ac-\\ntive compounds. Although exact comparisons have not\\nyet been determined, most Chinese practitioners use\\nabout half the customary dosage of gastrodia when they\\nare replacing it with Armillaria . The mushroom or the\\ngastrodia tuber are given in powdered form, in doses of\\n1.0–1.5 g, two or three times per day .\\nHerbal formulas\\nGastrodia has been a favorite herb to use in combi-\\nnation formulas to treat specific conditions. Most of\\nthese formulas are made up as tablets or capsules.

Gas-\\ntroenteritis typically lasts about three days. Adults usual-\\nly recover without problem, but children, the elderly , and\\npersons with an underlying disease are more vulnerable\\nto complications such as dehydration.\\nDescription\\nGastroenteritis is an uncomfortable and inconve-\\nnient ailment, but it is rarely life-threatening in the Unit-\\ned States and other developed nations. However, in the\\nUnited States an estimated 220,000 children younger\\nthan age five are hospitalized annually with gastroenteri-\\ntis symptoms. Of these children, 300 die as a result of se-\\nvere diarrhea and dehydration. In developing nations, di-\\narrhea-related illnesses are a major source of mortality .\\nIn 1990, approximately three million deaths occurred\\nworldwide as a result of diarrheal illness.\\nV iral gastroenteritis\\nGastroenteritis is usually caused by infection with\\none of these viruses: rotavirus, adenovirus, astrovirus,\\ncalicivirus, and small round-structured viruses (SRSVs).\\nThese viruses are found all over the world and are partic-\\nularly problematic where sanitation is poor. T ypical ex-\\nposure to these viruses occurs through the fecal-to-oral\\nroute, by ingesting food that is contaminated with fecal\\nmaterial or by coming in contact with an infected per-\\nson’s vomit or diarrhea and then inadvertently bringing\\nthe contaminant to the mouth. Other routes of transmis-\\nsion are quite likely , because exposure to as few as 100\\nvirus particles can cause an infection.\\nT ypically , children are more vulnerable to rotavirus-\\nes—the most common cause of acute watery diarrhea. It\\nis estimated that each year rotaviruses cause 800,000\\ndeaths worldwide in children younger than age five. For\\nthis reason, much research has gone into developing a\\nvaccine to protect children from this virus. Adults can be\\ninfected with rotaviruses, but these infections typically\\nhave minimal or no symptoms.\\nAdenoviruses and astroviruses are minor causes of\\nchildhood gastroenteritis, and children may become in-\\nfected with caliciviruses and SRSVs. Adults experience\\nillness from astroviruses as well, but the major causes of\\nadult viral gastroenteritis are the caliciviruses and SRSVs.\\nThe SRSVs are a type of calicivirus and include the Nor-\\nwalk, Southhampton, and Lonsdale viruses. SRSVs are\\nthe most likely to produce vomiting as a major symptom.\\nBacterial gastroenteritis\\nBacterial gastroenteritis is frequently a result of poor\\nsanitation, the lack of safe drinking water, or contaminat-\\ned food—conditions that are common in developing na-\\ntions. Natural or man-made disasters can worsen underly-\\ning sanitation and food-safety problems. In developed na-\\ntions, modern food production, handling, and distribution\\nsystems and methods may expose millions of people to\\ndisease-causing bacteria. Common types of bacterial gas-\\ntroenteritis can be linked to Salmonella and Campylobac-\\nter bacteria; however, Escherichia coli 0157 and Listeria\\nmonocytogenes are creating increased concern in devel-\\noped nations. Cholera and shigella remain two diseases of\\ngreat concern in developing countries, and research to de-\\nvelop long-term vaccines against them is underway .\\nCauses & symptoms\\nGastroenteritis arises from ingestion of viruses, cer-\\ntain bacteria, or parasites. Spoiled food may also cause\\nillness. Certain medications and excessive alcohol can ir-\\nritate the digestive tract to the point of inducing gas-\\ntroenteritis. Regardless of the cause, the symptoms of\\ngastroenteritis include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, ab-\\ndominal pain , and cramps. Sufferers may also experi-\\nence bloating, low fever, and overall tiredness. T ypically ,\\nthe symptoms last only two to three days, but some\\nviruses may last up to a week.\\nA typical bout of gastroenteritis should not require a\\nvisit to the doctor . However, medical treatment is essen-\\ntial if symptoms worsen or if there are complications. In-\\nfants, young children, the elderly , and persons with un-\\nderlying disease require special attention in this regard.\\nDehydration is the greatest danger presented by gas-\\ntroenteritis. The loss of fluids through diarrhea and vom-\\niting can upset the body’s electrolyte balance, leading to\\npotentially life-threatening problems, such as heart beat\\nabnormalities (arrhythmia). The risk of dehydration in-\\ncreases the longer that symptoms are present. Signs of\\ndehydration include a dry mouth, increased or excessive\\nthirst, or scanty urination.\\nSymptoms that do not clear up within a week may\\npoint to an infection or disorder more serious than gas-\\ntroenteritis. Symptoms of great concern include a fever\\nof 102°F (38.9°C) or above, blood or mucus in the diar-\\nrhea, blood in the vomit, and severe abdominal pain or\\nswelling. Persons experiencing these symptoms should\\nseek prompt medical attention.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe symptoms of gastroenteritis are usually sufficient\\nfor identifying the illness.

Symptoms of uncomplicated gastroen-\\nteritis can be relieved with adjustments in diet, herbal\\nremedies, and homeopathy . An infusion of mead-\\nowsweet ( Filipendula ulmaria ) may be effective in re-\\nducing nausea and stomach acidity . Once the worst\\nsymptoms are relieved, slippery elm (Ulmus fulva ) can\\nbe used to calm the digestive tract.\\nThe homeopathic remedies Arsenicum album ,\\nipecac , and Nux vomica are also believed to relieve the\\nsymptoms of gastroenteritis. In Chinese herbal medicine,\\nthe patent remedies Po Chai and Pill Curing can be ef-\\nfective for relieving nausea and diarrhea.\\nSupplementing the bacteria that are beneficial to a\\nperson’s health ( probiotics) is recommended during the\\nrecovery phase of gastroenteritis. Specifically , live cul-\\ntures of Lactobacillus acidophilus are said to be effective\\nin soothing the digestive tract and returning the intestinal\\nflora to normal. In fact, in 2002, a new study found it\\nwas reasonably effective in treating children with acute\\ninfectious diarrhea. L. acidophilus is found in live-cul-\\nture yogurt and in capsule or powder form at health food\\nstores. Castor oil packs applied to the abdomen can re-\\nduce inflammation, spasms, and discomfort.\\nIt is important to stay hydrated and nourished during\\na bout of gastroenteritis. In the absence of dehydration, it\\nshould be sufficient to drink generous amounts of nonal-\\ncoholic fluids, such as water or juice. Caffeine should be\\navoided, since it increases urine output.\\nThe traditional BRA T diet—bananas, rice, apple-\\nsauce, and toast—is tolerated by the tender gastrointesti-\\nnal system, but it is not particularly nutritious. Many , but\\nnot all, medical researchers recommend a diet that in-\\ncludes complex carbohydrates (rice, wheat, potatoes,\\nbread, and cereal, for example), lean meats, yogurt, fruit,\\nand vegetables. Milk and other dairy products shouldn’t\\ncreate problems if they are part of the normal diet. Fatty\\nfoods or foods with a lot of sugar should be avoided.\\nThese recommendations are based on clinical experience\\nand controlled trials, but are not universally accepted.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nOver-the-counter medications such as Pepto Bismol are\\nuseful in relieving the symptoms of gastroenteritis. These\\nmedications work by altering the intestine’ s ability to move\\nor secrete spontaneously , by absorbing toxins and water, or\\nby altering intestinal microflora. Some over-the-counter\\nmedicines use more than one element to treat symptoms,\\nand this information should be included on the label.\\nIf over-the-counter medications are ineffective, a\\ndoctor may prescribe a more powerful anti-diarrheal\\ndrug, such as motofen or lomotil. If pathogenic bacteria\\nor parasites are found in the patient’s stool sample, med-\\nications such as antibiotics will be prescribed.\\nMinimal to moderate dehydration is treated with\\noral rehydrating solutions that contain glucose and elec-\\ntrolytes. These solutions are commercially available\\nunder names such as Naturalyte, Pedialyte, Infalyte, and\\nRehydralyte. If vomiting prevents the patient from taking\\na full dose of solution, he or she may better tolerate fluid\\ntaken in small, frequent amounts. Should oral rehydra-\\ntion fail or severe dehydration occur, medical treatment\\nin the form of intravenous (IV) therapy is required. IV\\ntherapy can be followed with oral rehydration as the pa-\\ntient’s condition improves. Once normal hydration is\\nachieved, the patient can return to a regular diet.\\nSometimes, a child’s dehydration is so severe that it\\nrequires hospitalization with IV therapy . However, a\\nstudy published in 2002 informed pediatricians that\\noften, rapid intravenous rehydration and rapid nasogas-\\ntric hydration in the emergency department are safe and\\neffective alternatives to hospitalization for many children\\nwith viral gastroenteritis. Not only does this save money ,\\nit also saves a child the more frightening experience of\\nbeing in a hospital overnight and the routine laboratory\\ntesting he or she would endure in the hospital setting.\\nExpected results\\nGastroenteritis usually clears up within two to three\\ndays and there are no long-term effects. If dehydration\\noccurs, recovery is extended by a few days.\\nPrevention\\nGastroenteritis can be avoided by practicing good\\nhygiene, which includes washing hands thoroughly after\\nusing the bathroom or coming in contact with an infected\\nperson, using disinfectants to clean areas the infected\\nperson has come in contact with, and washing infected\\nlinens in hot water. Making sure that food is well-cooked\\nand unspoiled can prevent bacterial gastroenteritis, but\\nmay not be effective against viral gastroenteritis.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHoffman, David.

It is a woody , climbing vine with dark leaves and\\ngroups of yellow , bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early\\nspring. The flowers are very fragrant. It is native to the\\ncoastal areas extending from V irginia to Florida, and in\\nMexico, and is the state flower of South Carolina.\\nGelsemium contains extremely toxic alkaloid com-\\nponents, and is not in current medical use. Even very\\nsmall doses may prove lethal. It was reportedly discov-\\nered in the nineteenth century as a result of mistaken\\nidentity for another herb. A sick farmer took it for an at-\\ntack of “bilious fever, ” and became quite ill. When the\\nsymptoms resolved, he discovered that his prior illness\\nhad also disappeared. It came into use as an agent to treat\\nfever, spasmodic disorders, and the pain of neuralgia.\\nGeneral use\\nThe herb form of gelsemium has historically been\\nused for migraines resulting from excessive cerebral blood\\nflow , severe wheezing attacks of asthma, insomnia, and\\nnerve pain, particularly trigeminal neuralgia. The latter\\ncondition is a disorder of the trigeminal nerve, which caus-\\nes shooting pain in the area of the lips, gums, cheek, chin,\\nand occasionally around the eye. Use of the herb form has\\nnot been recommended for some time due to the extremely\\ntoxic potential of the alkaloids this plant contains.\\nHomeopathic remedies incorporating gelsemium\\nhave specific indications. As with other homeopathic\\ntreatments, they contain infinitesimal amounts of the ac-\\ntive ingredient, so that toxicity is highly unlikely . Some\\nof the recommendations for the use of homeopathic\\ngelsemium include migraine headache , anxiety ,\\nchemotherapy support, dental support, influenza , nau-\\nsea, and recovery from surgery .\\nHomeopathic gelsemium is thought to relieve anxi-\\nety in the form of apprehension about particular events,\\nas well as generalized anxiety . The 30C formulation is\\nrecommended for this purpose, taken as needed up to\\nthree or four times daily , for no longer than one week.\\nThe 6C formulation may be used two or three times prior\\nto undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Similar dosing is\\nrecommended prior to a visit to the dentist.\\nTrue influenza is a respiratory ailment, although\\nsymptoms also include aches, fever, chills , and\\nheadache . Homeopathic recommendations for gelsemi-\\num due to flu symptoms include mild fever, dull\\nheadache at the nape of the neck, and dizziness .\\nGelsemium 6C can be used for as long as five days, once\\nevery three to four hours, during the illness.\\nMigraine headaches that are felt primarily in the\\nback of the head or as constrictive pain may be helped by\\nhomeopathic preparations of gelsemium.

The disease is char-\\nacterized by the formation of fluid-filled, painful blisters\\nin the genital area.\\nDescription\\nGenital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease\\nspread by vaginal, anal, and oral contact. The first herpes\\ninfection a person has is called a primary infection. It de-\\nvelops about four to seven days after contact with the\\ndisease. Once a person has been infected with the herpes\\nvirus, it cannot be completely cured. Instead, the virus\\ncan lay latent in the sensory nerve ganglia for days,\\nmonths, or even years between outbreaks. When the\\nvirus becomes activated there is a recurrent infection of\\nthe skin. An active herpes infection is then obvious be-\\ncause of the sores that develop. However, an active infec-\\ntion may occur without visible sores. Up to 75% of peo-\\nple with herpes may not know they have the infection.\\nNewborn babies who are infected with herpes virus\\nexperience a very severe, and possibly fatal, disease\\ncalled neonatal herpes. In the United States, one in\\n3,000–5,000 babies born will be infected with herpes\\ntype of headache. For best results, gelsemium 30C is\\ntaken as soon as symptoms begin, every 30 minutes, for\\nup to three doses if needed.\\nHomeopathic gelsemium is also recommended to\\nsupport surgical recovery , particularly for those who are\\nquite apprehensive and restless. The 6C formulation may\\nbe taken for a few days preceding the surgery , up to four\\ndoses per day .\\nConsult a practitioner of homeopathy to determine\\nthe best indicated doses and combinations of remedies\\nfor a particular health issue.\\nPreparations\\nThe dried root, harvested in autumn, is the usable\\nportion of the plant. Gelsemium is currently unavailable\\nin medicinal formulations due to the narrow safety mar-\\ngins and dangerous toxicity .\\nPrecautions\\nGelsemium is an extremely toxic herb because of\\nthe alkaloid component, related to strychnine, which ex-\\nists in all parts of the plant. Symptoms can include\\nsweating, nausea, muscular weakness, dilated pupils,\\nlowered temperature, and convulsions. It can excessively\\ndepress the nervous system, and can cause death due to\\nrespiratory failure. A lethal dose is approximately 2–3\\ngrams for an adult, and 500 mg for a child. Ingestion of\\nas little as a single flower has reportedly resulted in the\\nfatality of a child. Accidental ingestion of the plant under\\nany circumstances warrants emergency treatment.\\nThe safety margin of gelsemium is extremely small. It\\nshould never be used, especially in children, or in women\\nwho are pregnant or lactating. Oral use of preparations from\\nthe rhizome or root are also considered unsafe. It is particu-\\nlarly dangerous for people with any sort of heart disease.\\nSide effects\\nThere are no reported side effects, although individ-\\nual aggravations may occur.\\nInteractions\\nThe effects of aspirin and phenacetin may be in-\\ncreased by gelsemium.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nLininger, Schuyler W ., Alan R.

The prodrome stage may occur anywhere from a\\nfew hours, to one or two days before an outbreak of the\\ninfection. Following that, small red bumps appear. These\\nbumps quickly become fluid-filled blisters that may also\\nfill with pus, and become covered with a scab. The blis-\\nters may burst and become painful sores. Blisters may\\ncontinue to erupt for a week or longer. Pain usually sub-\\nsides within two weeks, and the blisters and sores heal\\nwithout scarring by three to four weeks. It is possible to\\npass the virus to other parts of the body by touching an\\nopen sore and then bringing the fingers into contact with\\nthe mouth, the eyes, or a break in the skin. The highest\\nrisk for spreading the herpes virus is the time during the\\nappearance of blisters up to the formation of scabs. How-\\never, an infected person can spread herpes virus to other\\npeople even in the absence of sores.\\nW omen can experience a very severe and painful\\nprimary herpes infection. In addition to the vaginal area,\\nblisters often appear on the clitoris, at the urinary open-\\ning, in the rectum and around the anus, and on the but-\\ntocks and thighs. The cervix is almost always involved,\\ncausing a watery discharge. About one in 10 women get\\na vaginal yeast infection as a complication of herpes. In\\nmen, the herpes blisters usually form on the penis but\\ncan also appear on the scrotum, thighs, around the anus,\\nand in the rectum. Men may also have a urinary dis-\\ncharge with a genital herpes infection. Both men and\\nwomen may experience painful or difficult urination,\\nswelling of the urethra, meningitis , and throat infec-\\ntions, with women experiencing these symptoms more\\noften than men.\\nIt is unknown exactly what triggers a latent herpes\\nvirus to activate, but several conditions seem to be con-\\nnected with the onset of an active infection. These in-\\nclude illness, stress, tiredness, sunlight, menstruation ,\\nskin damage, food allergies , and extreme hot or cold\\ntemperatures. Most people with genital herpes experi-\\nence one or more outbreaks per year. About 40% experi-\\nence six or more outbreaks per year. Active recurrences\\nof herpes are usually less severe than the primary infec-\\ntion. There are fewer blisters, less pain, and the time pe-\\nriod from the beginning of symptoms to healing is short-\\ner than the primary infection.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause genital herpes is so common, it can be ini-\\ntially diagnosed by symptoms. A Tzanck test can also be\\nused for a quick initial diagnosis. It is performed using a\\nsample scraped from the base of an active blister. A con-\\nfirmation of the diagnosis can be done by making a tis-\\nvirus. Babies usually become infected during passage\\nthrough the birth canal, but they also can become infect-\\ned during pregnancy if the membranes rupture early .\\nCauses & symptoms\\nGenital herpes results from an infection by herpes\\nsimplex virus. There are several different kinds of human\\nherpes viruses. Only two of these, herpes simplex type 1\\n(HSV -1) and type 2 (HSV -2), can cause herpes. HSV -2 is\\nmost often responsible for genital infections . HSV -1\\nusually causes oral herpes, but it can also cause genital\\nherpes about 10-30% of the time. While the herpes virus\\ncan infect anyone, not everyone will show symptoms.\\nRisk factors include early age at first sexual activity ,\\nmultiple sexual partners, and a medical history of other\\nsexually transmitted diseases (STDs).\\nThe first symptoms of a primary herpes infection\\nusually occur within two to seven days after contact with\\nan infected person but may take up to two weeks. Symp-\\ntoms of a primary infection are usually more severe than\\nthose of recurrent infections. For up to 70% of people, a\\nprimary infection causes general symptoms such as\\ntiredness, headache, fever, chills, muscle aches, loss of\\nappetite, and painful, swollen lymph nodes. These symp-\\ntoms are greatest during the first three to four days of the\\ninfection and disappear within a week.\\nMost people with genital herpes experience pro-\\ndromes, or symptoms of the oncoming disease.

Homeopathic reme-\\ndies that may be helpful treatments for genital herpes in-\\nclude Rhus tox 6c and Apis mellifica 6c.\\nThere are traditional Chinese medicine combina-\\ntions that are useful for herpes outbreaks. One, called\\nZhi Bai Lui W ai Di Huang, is a mixture of philodendron\\nand other remedies. Another is Long Dan Xie Gan T ang,\\na soup made to drain the liver. A traditional Chinese\\nmedicine practitioner can help create the right combina-\\ntion specific to the outbreak.\\nRed marine algae, both taken internally and applied\\ntopically , is thought to be effective in treating herpes.\\nOther topical treatments may be helpful in inhibiting the\\ngrowth of the herpes virus, in minimizing the damage it\\ncauses, or in helping the sores heal. Zinc may also be\\nused both internally and externally . Oral supplementa-\\ntion coupled with an application of zinc sulfate ointment\\nmay help heal sores and fight recurrent outbreaks. Lithi-\\num succinate ointment may interfere with viral replica-\\ntion. An ointment made with glycyrrhizinic acid, a com-\\nponent of licorice , Glycyrrhiza glabra , seems to inacti-\\nvate the virus. T opical applications of vitamin E oil or\\ntea tree oil (Melaleuca spp.) help dry up the sores.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThere is no cure for a herpes infection. Aspirin may be\\nused to reduce pain and inflammation. Antiviral drugs are\\navailable that may lessen the symptoms and decrease the\\nlength of outbreaks. There is evidence that some may also\\nhelp prevent the spreading of the disease and reduce recur-\\nrence of future outbreaks. For the best results, treatment\\nwith antiviral drugs has to begin during the prodrome stage,\\nbefore blisters are visible. Depending on the length of the\\noutbreak, drug treatment may continue for up to 10 days.\\nAcyclovir (Zovirax) is the drug of choice for herpes\\ninfection and can be given intravenously , taken by\\nmouth, or applied directly to sores as an ointment. Intra-\\nvenous acyclovir is given to patients who require hospi-\\ntalization, usually due to severe primary infections or\\ncomplications of herpes such as aseptic meningitis or\\nsacral ganglionitis, an inflammation of nerve bundles.\\nAcyclovir reduces the virus shedding period, the dura-\\ntion of the blisters, and the healing time. Patients with\\nherpes outbreaks happening more often than six to eight\\nper year may be given a long-term course of treatment\\nwith acyclovir. This is referred to as suppressive therapy .\\nPatients on suppressive therapy have longer periods be-\\ntween herpes outbreaks. Alternatively , patients may use\\nshort-term suppressive therapy to lessen the chance of\\ndeveloping an active infection during special occasions\\nsuch as weddings or holidays. Side effects of acyclovir\\ninclude nausea , vomiting , itchy rash, and hives . Other\\ndrugs that may be used include famciclovir (Famvir),\\nvalacyclovir (V altrex), vidarabine (V ira-A), idoxuridine\\n(Herplex Liquifilm, Stoxil), trifluorothymidine (Virop-\\ntic), and penciclovir (Denavir).\\nNeonatal herpes is a serious condition. Even with\\ntreatment, babies may not survive or they may suffer se-\\nrious damage to the nervous system. Newborns with her-\\npes infections are normally treated with intravenous acy-\\nclovir or vidarabine for 10 days. However, infected ba-\\nbies may have to be treated with long-term suppressive\\ntherapy . These drugs have greatly reduced deaths and\\nhave also increased the number of babies who are rela-\\ntively healthy by one year of age.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 825\\nGenital herpes\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 825'),\n",

These warts are painless, pink or\\ngrayish growths on the skin and mucous membranes of\\nthe genitals and anal area. They are usually found in\\nclusters. Genital warts are very contagious and spread\\nthrough sexual contact with an infected person.\\nDescription\\nGenital warts are the most common sexually trans-\\nmitted disease (STD) in the general population of the\\nUnited States. It is estimated that 1% of sexually active\\npeople between the ages of 18 and 45 have genital warts;\\nhowever, studies indicate that as many as 40% of sexual-\\nly active adults may carry the virus that causes genital\\nwarts. Certain strains of the virus that cause genital warts\\nmay also cause cervical changes and cancer.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nGenital warts are caused by several subtypes of\\nHPV , the same virus that causes warts on other parts of\\nthe body . Symptoms develop about one to six months\\nafter being exposed to the virus.

In addition to the visible\\nwarts, symptoms may include bleeding, pain, odor, itch-\\ning, and redness in affected areas. These symptoms may\\nappear without the warts, and the warts may appear\\nwithout other symptoms. Stress may contribute to recur-\\nrent outbreaks.\\nGenital warts may be difficult to detect. At any\\ngiven time, at least a quarter of all HPV infections are in\\na state of regression, in which the infection remains dor-\\nmant in the body and there are no outbreaks of warts or\\nother readily detected symptoms. In addition, warts that\\noccur deep inside the vagina, on the cervix, or within the\\nanus may go undetected.\\nHPV can be transmitted through oral, anal, or geni-\\ntal contact with an infected person, even if warts are not\\nvisible. Care must be taken, because the virus may also\\nbe transmitted via objects that have been recently ex-\\nposed to the virus. These may include unwashed or im-\\nproperly cleaned medical equipment, as well as under-\\nwear, tanning beds, and sex toys.\\nRisk factors for contracting genital warts include:\\n• multiple sex partners\\n• infection with another sexually transmitted disease\\n(STD)\\n• pregnancy\\n• anal intercourse\\n• poor personal hygiene\\n• heavy perspiration\\nGenital warts vary somewhat in appearance. They\\nmay either be flat or resemble raspberries in appearance.\\nThe warts begin as small, red or pinkish growths. They\\nmay grow in clusters as large as four inches across, and\\nmay interfere with intercourse and childbirth. The warts\\ngrow on warm, moist tissue. In women, they occur on\\nthe external genitalia, the cervix, and the walls of the\\nvagina. In men, they develop in the urethra and on the\\nshaft of the penis. The warts may also spread to the area\\nsurrounding the anus.\\nDiagnosis\\nGenital warts are usually identified and diagnosed\\nby their characteristic appearance. A sexual history\\nshould be taken, and tests for other STDs may be admin-\\nistered. If cervical warts are suspected, a colposcopy\\nexam to view the cervix is necessary for diagnosis. A Pa-\\npanicolaou (pap) smear may be performed, and the doc-\\ntor may order a biopsy of the warts to rule out cancer.\\nT reatment\\nGenital warts are contagious, and should be as-\\nsessed and treated under the supervision of a healthcare\\npractitioner . A traditional Chinese medicine practition-\\ner or an acupuncturist will probably recommend treat-\\nments to cleanse the liver and enhance immune function-\\ning. A generally recommended homeopathic remedy is\\nthe application of a tincture of Thuja occidentalis (com-\\nmon names thuja, northern white cedar, and arborvitae,\\nor tree-of-life) directly to the warts. A homeopathic\\nphysician should be consulted for a work-up for further\\ntreatment.\\nThe direct topical application of vitamin A , thuja,\\nlomatium (Lomatium dissectum ) isolate, or tea tree\\noil (Melaleuca alternifolia ) helps resolve warts and\\nprevent recurrence of outbreaks. With the exception of\\nthe tea tree oil, these herbs should also be taken inter-\\nnally in addition to direct application. It has also been\\nnoted that deficiencies of folic acid and vitamins A\\nand C contribute to this condition. Such deficiencies\\nmay be risk factors for a progression to abnormal cer-\\nvical cells and cancer; therefore, supplementation is\\nrecommended. It should be noted that beta-carotene is\\noften suggested as an alternative to taking high\\ndosages of vitamin A.\\nTreatments that focus on emotional and psychologi-\\ncal factors have been shown to be effective in reducing\\nor eliminating outbreaks of warts.

There are about 180 species of gentians\\nworldwide. They have a long history of use in healing both\\nin Asian and W estern herbalism. In the W est, the com-\\nmon gentian used in healing is Gentiana lutea, or yellow\\ngentian. In China, two different gentians are used in heal-\\ning, Gentiana macrophylla, known in Chinese as qin jiao;\\nand Gentiana scabra, known in Chinese as long dan cao.\\nG. lutea grows wild or cultivated in many places\\nfrom Europe to India. It is also cultivated in North Amer-\\nica. It grows to a height of about 4 ft (1.2 m), primarily\\nin temperate alpine and subalpine meadows. The plant\\nproduces a spike of showy yellow-orange flowers. G.\\nmacrophylla grows in China and Siberia, and G. scabra\\ngrows in China and Japan.\\nThere are some differences in height, leaf size, and\\nflower among these three gentians, but the roots and rhi-\\nzomes (underground stems) used to make gentiana are\\nvery similar. Gentians have a single long, strong taproot\\nthat can extend as far as 3 ft (1 m) into the earth. The top\\nof the taproot can be as thick as a child’s arm and is sur-\\nrounded by a cluster of rhizomes. The root has an ex-\\ntremely bitter taste.

Gentian is one of the\\nmost intensely bitter herbs ever discovered. It is an in-\\ngredient in Angostura™ bitters. At one time it was used\\nas a substitute for hops in making beer. Gentiana is also\\nused in small amounts as a food flavoring, and is added\\nto many anti-smoking products.\\nIn W estern herbalism, gentiana is used for digestive\\nproblems. It is an ingredient in aperitifs that are drunk a\\nhalf-hour or so before eating to stimulate the appetite\\nand digestion. Liqueurs made using fresh gentiana have\\nbeen used for generations in Europe; in the eighteenth\\ncentury gentian wine was served before eating as a stom-\\nachic, or aid to digestion.\\nIn addition to stimulating digestion and appetite,\\ngentiana is used to relieve heartburn and stomach ache,\\nand to treat vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal fullness, and\\nintestinal gas. W estern herbalists also use gentiana for\\ntreating fever, sore throat , jaundice , and arthritis. It is\\nused externally to treat wounds.\\nIn traditional Chinese medicine , G. macrophylla ,\\nor qin jiao , is considered to have a neutral nature and a\\nbitter, pungent taste. It is associated with the liver, stom-\\nach, and gallbladder. It is used as a tonic for the digestive\\nsystem, and to treat arthritis; chronic low-grade fever;\\njaundice; hepatitis; and constipation. It is also an ingre-\\ndient of several common formulas.\\nAccording to Chinese herbalists, another gentian,\\nGentiana scabra , or long dan cao , has a cold nature and\\na bitter taste. It is associated with the liver, stomach,\\ngallbladder, and bladder. Long dan cao is used in formu-\\nlas to treat pink eye ( conjunctivitis ); high blood pres-\\nsure; acute urinary infections ; testicular pain ; leucor-\\nrhea (whitish vaginal discharge); vaginal pain; tantrums\\nin children; fever; and balance problems.\\nA long history of folk use coupled with modern sci-\\nentific investigation shows that gentiana works well as a\\nstomach tonic and digestive stimulant. The German Fed-\\neral Health Agency’s Commission E, established in 1978\\nto independently review and evaluate scientific literature\\nand case studies pertaining to herb and plant medications,\\nhas approved gentiana for use in Germany . It is consid-\\nered safe and effective in treating such digestive com-\\nplaints as loss of appetite, abdominal bloating, and gas.\\nIn laboratory studies gentiana was found to contain\\na substance called amargogentin, which is possibly the\\nbitterest compound ever found. It can be tasted at dilu-\\ntions of 1:50,000. Its bitterness triggers the secretion of\\nsaliva, thus stimulating the production of gastric juice\\nand bile and preparing the digestive system to process\\nfood. This reaction makes gentiana effective in treating\\nalmost all conditions related to sluggish digestion.\\nOther research shows that gentiana has selective an-\\ntifungal, anti-inflammatory , and antispasmodic activity\\nin laboratory experiments. There is much less scientific\\nevidence to support such other traditional uses as treat-\\ning pain and fever.\\nPreparations\\nGentian roots are harvested in the autumn.

It in-\\nvolves the use of hands to manipulate the soft tissues of\\nthe body to improve blood circulation, relieve pain, and\\nincrease range of motion. Active or passive movement of\\nthe joints may also be part of geriatric massage.\\nOld people often suffer from a variety of such age-\\nrelated diseases as Parkinson’s disease , arthritis, dia-\\nbetes, or heart disease. As a result, they have poor blood\\ncirculation and limited physical activity . Many of them\\nare also anxious, depressed, and lonely . Geriatric mas-\\nsage can help them maintain and improve their overall\\nhealth, as well as regain certain physical functions that\\nhave been reduced or lost due to aging . In addition, it\\ncan relieve anxiety and depression and provide comfort\\nto touch-deprived elderly patients.\\nOrigins\\nModern massage techniques were brought into the\\nUnited States from Sweden in the 1850s by two brothers, Dr.\\nCharles and Dr. George T aylor. Their massage technique\\nwas invented by a Swedish fencing instructor named Per\\nHenrik Ling in the 1830s. When he was injured in the el-\\nbows, he reportedly cured himself using tapping movements\\naround the affected area. He later developed the technique\\ncurrently known as Swedish massage. This massage tech-\\nnique involves the application of long gliding strokes, fric-\\ntion, kneading and tapping movements on the soft tissues of\\nthe body . Passive or active joint movements are also used.\\nBenefits\\nGeriatric massage offers the following benefits:\\n• Increase in blood circulation, thus preventing such\\ncomplications of diabetes as leg ulcers or gangrene.\\n• Improvement in lymphatic flow , which increases the\\nexcretion of toxic substances from the body .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2830\\nGeriatric massage\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAmargogentin —An extremely bitter substance\\nfound in gentian that makes it an effective diges-\\ntive stimulant.\\nRhizome —A root-like underground stem of a\\nplant.\\nStomachic —A substance or medication that\\nsharpens the appetite or stimulates digestion.\\nTincture —An alcohol-based extract prepared by\\nsoaking plant material.\\nT onic—Any medicine given to strengthen and in-\\nvigorate the body or a specific organ.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 830'),\n",

It is a general cleansing therapy for the entire\\nbody . The therapy can achieve the following:detoxifica-\\ntion, restoration of metabolic functions, enabling the diges-\\ntion and elimination of cancer masses through the blood\\nstream, and recovery of the organs, especially the liver.\\nOrigins\\nMax Gerson was a pioneer in the world of alternative\\nmedicine. His therapy proved itself by providing a cure for\\njust about every degenerative disease that plagues modern\\nsociety , at a time when the first rumblings of disenchant-\\nment with so-called “modern medicine” were being heard.\\nAmong his initial successes was a 99% cure rate at a sani-\\ntarium for tuberculosis, unheard of with allopathic medi-\\ncine. Beginning his work in the 1920s in Germany , he later\\nimmigrated to the United States, where in 1938 he was li-\\ncensed to practice in New Y ork. In 1946 he became the first\\nphysician to demonstrate recovered cancer patients before\\na U.S. Congressional Committee. Gerson had a 50% suc-\\ncess rate even with terminal cancer patients that allopathic\\nmedicine had given up on. Albert Schweitzer referred to\\nhim as “a medical genius that walked among us. ”\\nGerson first began to develop his therapy when he\\ndiscovered that he could cure himself from terrible mi-\\ngraines by eating nothing but fresh fruit and vegetables.\\nBenefits\\nGerson therapy has reported successes with the fol-\\nlowing: cancer, migraine, ulcers, asthma , glaucoma ,\\nedemas, eczema, diabetes, schizophrenia, emphysema,\\nepilepsy , allergies , psoriasis , tuberculosis, arterioscle-\\nrosis, heart diseases, rheumatoid arthritis , kidney dis-\\neases, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and high\\nblood pressure; all of them common diseases and condi-\\ntions. Gerson demonstrated that dramatic initial im-\\nprovements can be expected within one week of starting\\nhis therapy , which involves taking nothing but absolutely\\nfresh fruit and vegetable juices, coffee, chamomile and\\ncastor oil enemas, and additional nutrients according to\\nthe prescription of a practitioner who is conversant with\\nthe principles of the Gerson therapy .\\nDescription\\nGerson described how our food has been affected by\\nthe lowering of the quality of soil with the use of artifi-\\ncial fertilizers and pesticides. He went on to describe the\\ngrowing of fruits and vegetables as the human being’s\\n“external metabolism. ” He lists numerous examples in\\nhis book of people from around the world who were liv-\\ning the same existence that they have lived for centuries,\\nuntouched by “civilization. ” These people, he noted,\\nwere living free of the diseases that modern societies\\nconsidered commonplace.\\nIt is essential that the juices for this therapy are or-\\nganic; any traces of pesticides will prevent success with\\ndiseases such as cancer, for it is only when complete\\ndetoxification can be achieved that the body will be able\\nto overcome such scourges.\\nThe length of therapy will probably be between two\\nweeks and two months, depending on the illness. But for\\ncancer patients, it may be necessary to follow with an\\neasier form of the diet in order to prevent a recurrence.\\nThe cost of therapy varies. If carried out at home under\\nthe supervision of a physician, the major expenses will\\nbe doctor’s visits and organic fruit and vegetables. If\\nclinic treatment is preferred, the Gerson Institute can\\nhelp and advise.\\nPreparations\\nThe central theory of the Gerson therapy is fresh\\njuices, which should be drunk immediately after they are\\nprepared. When they are left for longer than 20 minutes,\\nthe vital enzymes begin to oxidize, and after about 40\\nminutes, will no longer be suitable for the therapy . The\\nfollowing should also be observed:\\n• A press-type juicer should be used; centrifuges do not\\nproduce satisfactory juice for this treatment.\\n• Fresh veal liver should be juiced (under 4 lb) and the\\njuice drunk raw (Gerson could find nothing better for\\nreplacing vital enzymes necessary for repairing the\\nhuman organism).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2832\\nGerson therapy\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 832'),\n",

A 1999 German\\nstudy reported the results from 12 volunteers who took\\n100 mg twice daily of ginger extract when fasting and\\nthen with a meal. In both instances, ginger was linked to\\nincreased digestive movement through the stomach and\\nduodenum.\\nA study in India published in 2000 reported the ef-\\nfects of ginger (in combination with other spices includ-\\ning cumin, fenugreek, and mustard) on pancreatic action\\nin rats.

Ginger cre-\\nates an anti-ulcer environment by multiplying the stom-\\nach’s protective components. Ginger’s anti-inflammatory\\nabilities have also been shown to help reduce hip and\\nknee pain in some osteoarthritis patients.\\nAccording to a 1998 report that reviewed the results\\nfrom 10 clinical studies, ginger also helps to suppress the\\nnausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy.

The ginkgo tree is the only surviving\\nspecies of the Ginkgoaceae family . This ancient decidu-\\nous tree may live for thousands of years. Ginkgo is in-\\ndigenous to China, Japan, and Korea, but also thrived in\\nNorth America and Europe prior to the Ice Age. This\\ndrastic climate change destroyed the wild ginkgo tree\\nthroughout much of the world. In China, ginkgo was cul-\\ntivated in temple gardens as a sacred tree known as bai\\ngou, thus assuring its survival there for more than 200\\nmillion years. Ginkgo fossils found from the Permian\\nperiod are identical to the living tree, which is sometimes\\ncalled a living fossil.\\nGinkgo trees may grow to 122 ft (37.2 m) tall and\\nmeasure 4 ft (1.2 m) in girth. The female trees have a\\nsomewhat pointed shape at the top, like a pyramid. The\\nmale trees are broader at the crown. The bark of the orna-\\nmental ginkgo tree is rough and fissured and may be ash\\nto dark-brown in color. Distinctive, fan-shaped leaves\\nwith long stalks emerge from a sheath on the stem.\\nLeaves are bright green in spring and summer, and turn to\\ngolden yellow in the fall. Ginkgo trees may take as long\\nas 30 years to flower. Ginkgo is dioecious, with male and\\nfemale flowers blooming on separate trees. Blossoms\\ngrow singly from the axils of the leaf. The female flowers\\nappear at the end of a leafless branch. The yellow , plum-\\nshaped fruits develop an unpleasant scent as they ripen.\\nThey contain an edible inner seed that is available in\\nAsian country marketplaces. Ginkgo’s longevity may be\\ndue, in part, to its remarkable resistance to disease, pollu-\\ntion, and insect damage. Ginkgo trees are part of the land-\\nscape plan in many urban areas throughout the world.\\nMillions of ginkgo trees, grown for harvest of the medici-\\nnal leaves, are raised on plantations in the United States,\\nFrance, South Korea, and Japan, and are exported to Eu-\\nrope for pharmaceutical processing.\\nGeneral use\\nGinkgo leaves, fresh or dry , and seeds, separated\\nfrom the outer layer of the fruit, are used medicinally .\\nGinkgo has remarkable healing virtues that have been\\nrecorded as far back as 2800 \\nB.C. in the oldest Chinese\\nmateria medica. Ginkgo seeds were traditionally served\\nto guests along with alcohol drinks in Japan. An enzyme\\npresent in the ginkgo seed has been shown in clinical re-\\nsearch to speed up alcohol metabolism in the body , un-\\nderscoring the wisdom of this folk custom. The leaf ex-\\ntract has been used in Asia for thousands of years to treat\\nallergies , asthma , and bronchitis . It is also valued in\\nChinese medicine as a heart tonic, helpful in the treat-\\nment of cardiac arrhythmia. Ginkgo was first introduced\\nto Europe in 1730, and to North America in 1784 where\\nit was planted as an exotic garden ornamental near\\nPhiladelphia. Ginkgo medicinal extracts are the primary\\nprescription medicines used in France and Germany .\\nGinkgo acts to increase blood flow throughout the\\nbody , particularly cerebral blood flow . It acts as a circu-\\nlatory system tonic, stimulating greater tone in the ve-\\nnous system. The herb is a useful and proven remedy for\\nnumerous diseases caused by restricted blood flow . Eu-\\nropean physicians prescribe the extract for treatment of\\nRaynaud’s disease, a condition of impaired circulation to\\nthe fingers. It is also recommended to treat intermittent\\nclaudication, a circulatory condition that results in\\npainful cramping of the calf muscles in the leg that im-\\npairs the ability to walk. German herbalists recommend\\ningesting the extract for treatment of leg ulcers, and large\\ndoses are used to treat varicose veins . Ginkgo is widely\\nrecommended in Europe for the treatment of stroke. The\\ndried leaf extract may also act to prevent hemmorrhagic\\nstroke by strengthening the blood capillaries throughout\\nthe body . In studies of patients with atherosclerotic clog-\\nging of the penile artery , long-term therapy with ginkgo\\nextract has provided significant improvement in erectile\\nfunction.

In 2002, studies suggested that al-\\nthough gingko does have positive effects on dementia ,\\nits effects on age-related memory loss and tinnitus\\n(ringing in the ears) are not scientifically proven. The\\nherbal extract has also been shown to improve long-dis-\\ntance vision and may reverse damage to the retina of the\\neye. Studies have also demonstrated its value in the treat-\\nment of depression in elderly persons. The ginkgo ex-\\ntract may provide relief for persons with headache ,s i -\\nnusitis, and vertigo.\\nThe active constituents in the ginkgo tree, known as\\nginkgolides, interfere with a blood protein known as the\\nplatelet activating factor, or P AF . Other phytochemicals\\nin ginkgo include flavonoids, bioflavonoids , proantho-\\ncyanidins, trilactonic diterpenes (including the\\nginkgolides A, B, C, and M), and bilabolide, a trilactonic\\nsesquiterpene. The therapeutic effects of this herb have\\nnot been attributed to a single chemical constituent;\\nrather, the medicinal benefits are due to the synergy be-\\ntween the various chemical constituents. The standard-\\nized extract of ginkgo must be taken consistently to be\\neffective. A period of at least 12 weeks of use may be re-\\nquired before the beneficial results are evident.\\nPreparations\\nGinkgo’s active principles are diluted in the leaves.\\nThe herb must be processed to extract the active phyto-\\nchemicals before it is medicinally useful. It would take\\nan estimated 50 fresh ginkgo leaves to yield one standard\\ndose of the extract. Dry extracts of the leaf, standardized\\nto a potency of 24% flavone glycosides and 6% terpenes,\\nare commercially available. A standard dose is 40 mg,\\nthree times daily , though dosages as high as 240 mg\\ndaily are sometimes indicated.\\nGinkgo extracts are widely used in Europe where\\nthey are sold in prescription form or over the counter as\\nan approved drug. This is not the case in the United\\nStates, where ginkgo extract is sold as a food supplement\\nin tablet and capsule form.\\nPrecautions\\nGinkgo is generally safe and non-toxic in therapeutic\\ndosages. Exceeding a daily dose of 240 mg of the dried\\nextract may result in restlessness, diarrhea , and mild\\ngastrointestinal disorders. Those on anticoagulants should\\nhave their doctor adjust their dose or should avoid ginkgo\\nin order to avoid over-thinning their blood and hemor-\\nrhaging. Ginkgo should be avoided two days before and\\none to two weeks after surgery to avoid bleeding compli-\\ncations. Pregnant women should avoid ginkgo supple-\\nments because scientists have discovered a compound\\ncalled colchicine in the placental blood of women who\\ntook ginkgo biloba. A 2002 report cautioned that the\\ncompound could cause problems for the growing fetus.\\nIn 2002, a case of ginkgo seed poisoning was report-\\ned in a toddler in Japan, but she had ingested 50 or more\\npieces of roasted ginkgo seeds. She experienced severe\\nvomiting and seizures.\\nSide effects\\nSevere allergic skin reactions, similar to those\\ncaused by poison ivy , have been reported after contact\\nwith the fruit pulp of ginkgo. Eating even a small\\namount of the fruit has caused severe gastrointestinal ir-\\nritation in some persons. People with persistent\\nheadaches should stop taking ginkgo. Some patients on\\nmedications for nervous system disease should avoid\\nginkgo. It can interact with some other medicines, but\\nclinical information is still emerging.\\nInteractions\\nThe chemically active ginkgolides present in the ex-\\ntract, specifically the ginkgolide B component, act to re-\\nduce the clotting time of blood and may interact with an-\\ntithrombotic medicines, including aspirin.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 837'),\n",

Odle\\nGinseng, American\\nDescription\\nAmerican ginseng, scientific name P anax quinque-\\nfolius, is a close relative of Korean ginseng (P anax gin-\\nseng), and belongs to the Araliaceae family , which is the\\nsame as Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus).\\nIt is a perennial herb, distinguished by its dark green\\nleaves and clusters of red berries, that grows wild in east-\\nern North America. The root of the plant is used medici-\\nnally , particularly in China, where traditional Chinese\\nmedicine places a high value on it.\\nOf the traditional ginsengs, American ginseng is\\nprobably the least used and researched variety . Ameri-\\ncans have never been large consumers of American gin-\\nseng. In the past, American ginseng was an uncommon\\nfolk remedy used as a mild stimulant, tonic, and diges-\\ntive aid. Most of this herb was exported to China, where\\nmost ginseng is consumed. American ginseng is consid-\\nered a less potent member of the ginseng family , but it is\\na highly prized tonic and herbal remedy .\\nAmerican ginseng was used medicinally by many Na-\\ntive American tribes as a health stimulant and sexual tonic\\nand for various health problems including headaches, fe-\\nmale infertility, digestive problems, fever, and earache.\\nAmerican ginseng was introduced by Native Americans to\\nEuropean settlers in North America in the early 1700s. A\\nFrench Jesuit priest named Jartoux had traveled through\\nChina and was convinced of the medicinal powers of Kore-\\nan ginseng. In 1714, he published a paper in Britain about\\nKorean ginseng and its healing powers, and theorized that\\nthe plant may grow wild in the favorable climate of North\\nAmerica. Another Jesuit missionary in Canada, Joseph\\nLafitau (1681-1746), read the article and began searching\\nthe woods near his dwelling. Lafitau found American gin-\\nseng plants, which bear a close resemblance to their Asian\\ncousins, and sent samples of them to China. A thriving\\ntrade of American ginseng began around 1718, it was sent\\nto the Orient, gathered by Native Americans, French fur\\ntraders, and early frontiersmen including Daniel Boone.\\nAmerican ginseng grows wild in the forests of the\\neastern United States and southeastern Canada. It grows\\nin shady , moist and hilly regions, but the plant is becom-\\ning increasingly scarce due to over-harvesting and log-\\nging practices. In Kentucky , T ennessee, V irginia, and\\nIllinois, American ginseng holds status as a threatened or\\nan endangered species. Some botanists believe that pol-\\nlution and a thinning ozone layer are contributing to its\\ndecline. Efforts at protecting wild American ginseng\\nhave not been successful, as the demand for it in the Far\\nEast makes it a lucrative crop for poachers. It sometimes\\nsells for as much as $600-800 per pound.\\nThe majority of American ginseng on the market is\\nnow cultivated, although it is a sensitive plant and diffi-\\ncult to farm. In the United States, Wisconsin grows 80%\\nof the American ginseng crop. Canada grows more\\nAmerican ginseng than any country , and is second only\\nto China in total ginseng production.\\nScientific research\\nThe majority of research performed on ginseng has\\nbeen done on the Korean and Siberian varieties. Clinical\\nand chemical research on American ginseng is yet to be\\ndone. One reason for this is the American medical estab-\\nlishment’s skepticism of herbal remedies.\\nAmerican ginseng is classified as an adaptogen,\\nwhich is a substance that helps the body adapt to stress\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2838\\nGinseng, American\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 838'),\n",

American gin-\\nseng, according to Chinese herbalists, is more suitable and\\nbalancing for women and children than P anax ginseng,\\nand is more applicable for the elderly who wish to avoid\\nstimulants.

For whole roots,\\nwild ginseng is the highest quality and also the most ex-\\npensive. Also available are organically grown cultivated\\nroots, which are free from pesticides and chemicals. The\\neasiest way to prepare ginseng roots is to make a tea\\nfrom them. Ginseng roots are very hard and brittle. They\\nshould be sliced and simmered in water for 45 minutes\\nor longer to extract the majority of ginsenocides. Experts\\nand improves immune response.

American ginseng root has an array of com-\\nplex chemicals, and scientists have determined that the\\nactive ingredients are saponin triterpenoid glycosides, or\\nchemicals commonly called ginsenocides. American gin-\\nseng contains nearly 30 ginsenocides. However, Ameri-\\ncan ginseng has been found to contain higher levels of\\nginsenocide Rb1, which has a sedative effect on the cen-\\ntral nervous system, than other species of ginseng. Thus,\\nscientific research has been consistent with Chinese\\nherbalists’ claims that American ginseng is less stimulat-\\ning than Korean ginseng.

White ginseng is simply\\nthe dried or powdered root of Korean ginseng, while red\\nginseng is the same root that is steamed and dried in heat\\nor sunlight. Red ginseng is said to be slightly stronger\\nand more stimulating in the body than white, according\\nto Chinese herbalism.\\nKorean ginseng has had a long and illustrious histo-\\nry as an herb for health, and has been used for thousands\\nof years throughout the Orient as a medicine and tonic.\\nEarly Chinese medicine texts written in the first century\\nA.D. mention ginseng, and ginseng has long been classi-\\nfied by Chinese medicine as a “superior” herb. This\\nmeans it is said to promote longevity and vitality . Leg-\\nends around the world have touted ginseng as an aphro-\\ndisiac and sexual tonic. Researchers have found a slight\\nconnection between sex drive and consuming ginseng,\\nalthough a direct link and the mechanism of action are\\nstill researched and disputed.\\nKorean ginseng grows on moist, shaded mountain-\\nsides in China, Korea, and Russia. It is a perennial herb\\nthat reaches heights of two or more feet, and is distin-\\nguished by its dark green leaves and red clusters of\\nberries. The root of the plant is the part valued for its\\nmedicinal properties. The root is long and slender and\\nsometimes resembles the shape of the human body .\\nAsian legends claim that this “man-root” has magical\\npowers for those lucky enough to afford or find it, and\\nthe roots bearing the closest resemblance to the human\\nbody are still the most valuable ones. The word ren shen\\nin Chinese means roughly “the essence of the earth in\\nthe shape of a man. ”\\nKorean ginseng has historically been one of the\\nmost expensive of herbs, as it has been highly in demand\\nin China and the Far East for centuries. W ars have been\\nfought in Asia over lands where it grew wild. Wild Kore-\\nan ginseng is now nearly extinct from many regions. Sin-\\ngle roots of wild plants have recently been auctioned in\\nChina and New Y ork City for sums approaching\\n$50,000. Most of the world’s supply of Korean ginseng\\nis cultivated by farmers in Korea and China.\\nBecause of the number of herbs sold under the name\\nof ginseng, there can be some confusion for the consumer.\\nKorean ginseng is a member of the Araliaceae family of\\nplants, which also includes closely related American gin-\\nseng (P anax quinquefolius ) and Siberian ginseng\\n(Eleutherococcus senticosus). Both American and Siber-\\nian ginseng are considered by Chinese herbalists to be dif-\\nferent herbs than Korean ginseng, and are said to have dif-\\nferent effects and healing properties in the body . T o add\\nmore confusion, there are eight herbs in Chinese medicine\\nwhich are sometimes called ginseng, including black gin-\\nseng, purple ginseng, and prince’s ginseng, some of which\\nare not at all botanically related to P anax ginseng, so con-\\nsumers should choose ginseng products with awareness.\\nGeneral use\\nThe word panax is formed from Greek roots mean-\\ning “cure-all, ” and P anax ginsenghas long been consid-\\nered to be one of the great healing and strengthening\\nherbs in natural medicine. Ginseng is classified as an\\nadaptogen, which is a substance that helps the body adapt\\nto stress and balance itself without causing major side ef-\\nfects. Korean ginseng is used as a tonic for improving\\noverall health and stamina, and Chinese herbalists partic-\\nularly recommend it for the ill, weak, or elderly . Korean\\nginseng has long been asserted to have longevity , anti-se-\\nnility , and memory improvement effects in the aged pop-\\nulation. As it helps the body to adapt to stress, athletes\\nmay use ginseng as herbal support during rigorous train-\\ning. Korean ginseng generally increases physical and\\nmental energy .

Another 1982 study showed that\\nathletes given ginseng had improved oxygen intake and\\nfaster recovery time than those given placebos.\\n• Mental performance improvement and mood enhance-\\nment: In general, studies show that ginseng enhances\\nmental performance, learning time, and memory . One\\nstudy of sixteen volunteers showed improvement on a\\nwide variety of mental tests, including mathematics.\\nAnother study showed that those performing intricate\\nand mentally demanding tasks improved performance\\nwhen given Korean ginseng. Finally , a study has shown\\nimprovement of mood in depression sufferers with the\\nuse of ginseng.\\n• Antifatigue and antistress actions: Patients with chronic\\nfatigue who were given ginseng showed a statistically\\nsignificant improvement in physical tests and in mental\\nattention and concentration, when compared with those\\ngiven placebos.\\n• Lowering blood sugar: Animal studies have shown that gin-\\nseng can facilitate the release of insulin from the pancreas\\nand increase the number of insulin receptors in the body .\\n• Antioxidant properties: Scientific analysis of ginseng\\nhas shown that it has antioxidant effects, similar to the\\neffects of vitamins A, C, and E. Thus, ginseng could be\\nbeneficial in combating the negative effects of pollu-\\ntion, radiation, and aging.\\n• Cholesterol reduction: Some studies have shown that\\nKorean ginseng reduces total cholesterol and increases\\nlevels of good cholesterol in the body .\\n• Anticancer effects and immune system stimulation:\\nSeveral tests have shown that Korean ginseng increases\\nimmune cell activity in the body , including the activity\\nof T -cells and lymphocytes, which are instrumental in\\nfighting cancer and other immune system disorders like\\nAIDS. A Korean study indicates that taking ginseng\\nmay reduce the chances of getting cancer, as a survey\\nof more than 1,800 patients in a hospital in Seoul\\nshowed that those who did not have cancer were more\\nlikely to have taken ginseng regularly than those pa-\\ntients who had contracted cancer.\\n• Physical and mental improvement in the elderly: One\\nstudy showed significant improvement in an elderly\\ntest group in visual and auditory reaction time and car-\\ndiopulmonary function when given controlled amounts\\nof Korean ginseng. Korean ginseng has also been\\nshown to alleviate symptoms of menopause.\\n• Impotence: Studies of human sexual function and Ko-\\nrean ginseng have been generally inconclusive, despite\\nthe wide acclaim of ginseng as a sexual tonic.

It is in the\\nsame botanical family as Korean ginseng (P anax gin-\\nseng ) and American ginseng (P anax quinquefolius ).\\nSiberian ginseng is one of the most widely used herbs in\\nthe world.\\nSiberian ginseng is a thin, thorny shrub that grows\\nup to 15 ft (4.6 m) high. It is native to forests in south-\\neastern Russia, northern China, Japan, and Korea. The\\nroot of the plant is used medicinally .\\nThe family of ginseng plants has historically been\\nused for medicinal purposes. Korean ginseng, also called\\nAsian, red, or white ginseng, has been used in China for\\nthousands of years. In China, it is a celebrated herb\\nknown to promote strength, energy , and longevity . Amer-\\nican ginseng was discovered in North America in the\\nearly 1700s, and has since been used as a medicine and\\ntonic. Siberian ginseng has been used in Chinese medi-\\ncine for more than 2,000 years, to increase energy and\\nvitality and to treat respiratory and other infections ,a l -\\nthough Chinese herbalists use Korean and American gin-\\nseng much more frequently . Siberian ginseng was used\\nin Eastern Europe as a folk remedy for hundreds of\\nyears, but it was not until the 1940s that it became a pop-\\nular herb in Russia and Europe.\\nThe Russian physician I. I. Brekhman is credited\\nwith making Siberian ginseng popular. Brekhman had\\nstudied Korean ginseng in the 1940s and documented\\nsome of its effects on the body . He determined that gin-\\nseng was an adaptogen. T o be classified as an adaptogen,\\nan agent must be shown to help the body adapt to stress,\\nimprove balance and overall immune function, be non-\\ntoxic and cause minimal side effects. Brekhman\\nsearched his native Russian forests for an alternative to\\nexpensive Korean ginseng, and concentrated on Siberian\\nginseng. Brekhman discovered that Siberian ginseng was\\nalso an adaptogen, offering some of the same benefits of\\nKorean ginseng, although containing a different chemi-\\ncal composition.\\nDuring the next 30 years in the Soviet Union, Siber-\\nian ginseng became the focus of many studies. It was\\nfound to increase endurance and performance of athletes,\\nand many famous Soviet Olympic champions included\\nSiberian ginseng as part of their training programs.\\nSiberian ginseng was so touted that Soviet astronauts\\ncarried it into space with them, as opposed to the am-\\nphetamines carried by American astronauts. Soviet sci-\\nentists found that Siberian ginseng strengthened the im-\\nmune system, and gave Siberian ginseng to highly\\nstressed workers as herbal support. After the Chernobyl\\nnuclear accident, Siberian ginseng was given to people\\nwho had been exposed to radiation.\\nResearch\\nSiberian ginseng’s active ingredients are a complex\\ngroup of chemicals called eleutherosides. Eleutherosides\\nare different than the ginsenocides found in the P anax\\nvarieties of ginseng, which is consistent with Chinese\\nherbalists’ claims that Siberian ginseng acts differently\\nin the body than Korean or American ginseng. There has\\nbeen some debate among herbalists whether Siberian\\nginseng should be considered a true ginseng at all, due to\\nthis difference in active ingredients.\\nMuch of the research done on Siberian ginseng was\\nperformed by Soviet scientists in the former Soviet Union.\\nMany of the study results are still unavailable in English.\\nThose that have been translated and more recent studies\\nhave corroborated the benefits of Siberian ginseng.\\n• Siberian ginseng has been documented in many studies\\nto improve physical endurance, oxygen uptake, recov-\\nery , and overall performance in athletes, ranging from\\nrunners to weightlifters. A 1986 study in Japan showed\\nthat eleuthero ginseng improves oxygen uptake in exer-\\ncising muscle.\\n• Siberian ginseng normalized blood pressure in patients\\nwith high and low blood pressure. Siberian ginseng has\\nbeen shown to reduce stress symptoms in general. A\\n1996 study in Japan concluded that Siberian ginseng\\ncan protect against gastric ulcers.\\n• Animal studies showed Siberian ginseng helped fight\\nagainst toxic chemicals and exposure to harmful levels\\nof radiation. A 1992 Russian study showed that Siber-\\nian ginseng reduced the occurrence of tumors in rats\\nwhen exposed to radiation. Another Russian study\\nshowed that women undergoing radiation for breast\\ncancer had a significant reduction of side effects when\\ngiven Siberian ginseng.\\n• A 1987 German study , using human subjects in a dou-\\nble-blind test, demonstrated that eleuthero ginseng\\nboosts immune system response and enhances the\\nbody’s overall resistance to infection. Other studies\\nhave shown that Siberian ginseng increases activity of\\nlymphocytes and killer cells in the immune system.\\nGeneral use\\nSiberian ginseng can be used as an overall strength-\\nener for the body and immune system.

Frey , PhD\\nGlaucoma\\nDefinition\\nGlaucoma is a slowly progressive eye condition that\\ncauses damage to the optic nerve. It is the leading cause\\nof blindness among African-Americans and older adults\\nin the United States. Because there are usually no symp-\\ntoms early on in the disease, about half of the people\\nwith glaucoma do not even know they have it.\\nDescription\\nOver two million people in the United States have\\nglaucoma, and 80,000 of those are legally blind as a re-\\nsult of the disease. Glaucoma can strike any age group,\\neven newborn infants. Susceptibility to the disease in-\\ncreases with age. African-Americans are at a three times\\nhigher risk of glaucoma than the rest of the population.\\nThere are at least 20 different types of glaucoma.\\nThese can be divided into four main types:\\n• Open-angle glaucoma. Accounts for over 60–70% of\\nall cases. It is usually chronic and often bilateral.\\n• Closed-angle glaucoma. Usually an acute condition, as\\nopposed to open-angle glaucoma that is chronic.\\n• Congenital glaucoma occurs in infants, usually under\\nthe age of one.\\n• Secondary glaucoma may be associated with eye dis-\\neases, other diseases, and certain types of medications.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nGlaucoma is the result of disruptions of normal\\nprocesses to maintain pressure within the eye tissue. The\\niris, cornea, and lens of the eye are bathed in a nutritive\\nliquid called the aqueous humor, which is made by cells\\nwithin the eye. Excess fluid is continually removed by a\\nspongy meshwork of drainage canals. Glaucoma occurs\\nif there is a build up of the aqueous humor due to poor\\ndrainage or overproduction. As the fluid builds up there\\nis increased pressure on the retina at the back of the eye.\\nThis increases the pressure, reducing the blood supply to\\nthe nerves of the retina, causing the nerves to die. This\\nmay distort and destroy the optic nerve. As nerve cells\\nare destroyed, blind spots develop, and there is a pro-\\ngressive loss of vision. A change in the production and\\nstrength of collagen may also contribute to the onset of\\nthe disease. Collagen is a protein that helps maintain the\\nstructure and function of eye tissue. Stress and allergies\\nmay aggravate glaucoma symptoms.\\nIt is probable that most cases of glaucoma are par-\\ntially due to a genetic predisposition. At least 10 defective\\ngenes have been identified that may cause glaucoma. Al-\\nthough there are still many unknown factors that trigger\\nthe disease, a number of processes have been implicated.\\nThey include age-related changes, congenital abnormali-\\nties, injuries to the eye tissue, and problems related to\\nother eye diseases. V ision loss in all forms of glaucoma is\\ncaused by damage to the optic nerve, the retina, and the\\ncollagen protein that makes up eye tissue. Use of certain\\nmedications, including antihypertensives, antihistamines,\\nanticholinergics, and antidepressants may also contribute\\nto the development of glaucoma. Corticosteroid eye\\ndrops, which are often used for other eye disorders, may\\ndestroy the integrity of eye tissue. Other types of eye\\ndrops may cause the pupils to dilate, increasing intraocu-\\nlar eye pressure (IOP), which may also lead to glaucoma\\nin those who have a tendency to the disease.\\nChronic open-angle glaucoma at first develops with-\\nout noticeable symptoms. The pressure buildup is grad-\\nual and it does not bring on discomfort. Moreover, the\\nvision loss is too gradual to be noticed at first, and the\\nbrain will compensate for blind spots. Over an extended\\nperiod of time, the elevated pressure pushes against and\\ndamages the optic nerve and the retina. If glaucoma is\\nleft untreated, vision loss becomes evident and the con-\\ndition becomes painful.\\nAcute closed-angle glaucoma is obvious from the\\nbeginning. The symptoms are blurred vision, severe eye\\npain, sensitivity to light, nausea and vomiting , dilated\\npupils, reddened eyes, and halos visualized around\\nlights. The corneas may become hazy-looking. Acute\\nclosed-angle glaucoma is an emergency situation. It\\nneeds to be treated immediately . Congenital glaucoma is\\nevident at birth. Symptoms are bulging eyes, cloudy\\ncorneas, enlarged corneas, excessive teariness, and sensi-\\ntivity to light.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2846\\nGlaucoma\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAdaptogen —Substance that helps the body adapt\\nto stress.\\nEleutheroside—Active chemical found in Siberian\\nginseng.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 846'),\n",

IOP , defects in the field of vision,\\nand the appearance of the optic nerve, are all considered in\\nthe diagnosis of glaucoma. V isual field tests can detect\\nblind spots in a patient’s field of vision before the patient\\nis aware of them. An instrument, known as a tonometer, is\\nused to measure eye pressure. Since IOP can vary\\nthroughout the day , a person may have to return for sever-\\nal visits to measure eye pressure at different times of the\\nday . An ophthalmoscope is used to examine the inner as-\\npects and the back of the eyes, including the optic nerve,\\nfor changes and damage. A slit lamp may be used to allow\\nthe doctor further examination of the eye. Another test,\\ngonioscopy , can distinguish between narrow-angle and\\nopen-angle glaucoma. A gonioscope allows visualization\\nof the angle between the iris and the cornea.\\nT reatment\\nVitamin C, taken in dosages up to bowel tolerance,\\nis reported to reduce pressure within the eye and restore\\ncollagen balance. A vitamin C supplement with\\nbioflavonoids, especially rutin and lutein, are particular-\\nly recommended. There is evidence that marijuana\\n(Cannabis sativa ) lowers IOP , as well. Although it is a\\ncontrolled substance, marijuana can often be prescribed\\nby a professional licensed to treat glaucoma. Bilberry\\n(V acciniumsp.) helps maintain collagen balance and pre-\\nvents the breakdown of vitamin C. Many people with\\nglaucoma have been shown to have deficiencies of\\nchromium and zinc . Supplementation with these two\\nminerals may , therefore, deter the onset or progression of\\nthe disease. Alpha lipoic acid and other antioxidants\\nmay improve visual functioning.\\nA naturopathic approach called contrast hydrother-\\napy can be used to stimulate circulation in the eyes.\\nCompresses can be applied over the eyes, alternating\\nthree minutes with hot water and one minute with cold\\nwater, always ending with the cold. Biofeedback can be\\nused to reduce the pressure in the eyes by increasing re-\\nlaxation . Meditation , stress reduction, t’ai chi , yoga,\\nexercise , and acupuncture also may lower IOP . Reme-\\ndies used to lower IOP must be taken continually to\\navoid optic nerve damage. In addition to other treat-\\nments, a glaucoma patient should always remain under\\nthe care of an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is li-\\ncensed to treat glaucoma, so that IOP and optic nerve\\ndamage can be monitored.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThe objective of glaucoma treatment is usually to\\ndecrease IOP . When glaucoma is diagnosed, drugs, typi-\\ncally given as eye drops, are usually tried before surgery .\\nSeveral classes of medications are effective at lowering\\nIOP and thus, at preventing optic nerve damage in chron-\\nic and neonatal glaucoma. These inlcude beta-blockers,\\nsuch as Timoptic, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,\\nsuch as acetazolamide. Alpha-2 agonists, such as Alpha-\\ngan, inhibit the production of aqueous humor. Miotics,\\nsuch as pilocarpine, and prostaglandin analogues, like\\nXalatan, increase the drainage of aqueous humor.

It is most effective in treating osteoarthritis\\n(OA), the most prevalent type of arthritis. A number of\\nstudies over the last 20 years have shown that glu-\\ncosamine is helpful in relieving arthritis symptoms. For\\nexample, a 1982 clinical study compared usage of the\\nNSAID ibuprofen with glucosamine sulfate, for os-\\nteoarthritis of the knee. During the first two weeks,\\nibuprofen decreased pain faster, but by the fourth week\\nthe glucosamine group was well ahead in pain relief.

A British\\nstudy published in 2002 reported similar findings regard-\\ning the effectiveness of glucosamine in relieving pain as-\\nsociated with arthritis. A team of Japanese researchers\\nhas suggested that glucosamine relieves the pain of\\narthritis by suppressing the functions of neutrophils,\\nwhich are white blood cells that contribute to the joint\\ninflammation found in arthritis. Other researchers think\\nthat the sulfur content of glucosamine contributes to its\\nhealing properties.\\nSeveral studies have concluded that over-the-counter\\npreparations of glucosamine sulfate are safe for long-term\\ntreatment of osteoarthritis. These are readily available in\\nthe dietary supplement sections of most pharmacies. Glu-\\ncosamine preparations are sometimes classified as nu-\\ntraceuticals, a term used to refer to foods or food ingredi-\\nents that are thought to provide medical or health benefits.\\nHarvard Medical School recently conducted a some-\\nwhat unorthodox study in which patients scheduled for\\nhip surgery were given ground chicken bone supple-\\nments.

There are also dif-\\nfering opinions on which is better.\\nOne claim states that glucosamine hydrochloride\\nworks 50% better than glucosamine sulfate because hy-\\ndrocholoride is the main stomach acid helping the diges-\\ntive system to put more active ingredients into the body .\\nAnother prefers glucosamine sulfate because of its high\\nabsorption rate of 98% documented in human studies and\\nits sulfur content.

Although\\nstudies show that chondroitin sulfate has benefits, it is\\nhard to absorb because it contains large molecules.\\nFurther confusion can arise because glucosamine is\\nclassified and sold as a dietary supplement, meaning it\\nhas not gone through the FDA approval process.

Frey , PhD\\nGlutamine\\nDescription\\nIn healthy individuals, glutamine is a neutral,\\nnonessential amino acid. Amino acids are critical to hu-\\nmans, since they form the proteins that are the building\\nblocks for many body tissues, including muscles. Gluta-\\nmine is the most abundant amino acid in our bodies. It\\nperforms several important functions in the body , partic-\\nularly in those that are stressed because of certain dis-\\neases or conditions. Glutamine can be added to the body\\nmedically by physicians or through dietary supplements\\nthat people purchase without prescriptions.\\nGeneral use\\nResearchers continue to study glutamine’s proper-\\nties and effects. It is the most plentiful amino acid in the\\nbloodstream and the body continues to produce it unless\\nsome sort of stress occurs. Cancer, burns or trauma, ex-\\ncessive exercise, and certain other stressful situations to\\nthe body may cause glutamine levels to drop.\\nResearch suggests that when glutamine levels fall\\nand are not replaced, several body functions are affected,\\nparticularly within the digestive tract. Glutamine also is\\nconsidered important to overall immunity , or ability to\\nfight off diseases and infections. In the past few decades,\\ninterest has grown for use of glutamine in helping cancer\\npatients. Research continues on using glutamine therapy\\nto help patients with sepsis, burns, trauma, inflammato-\\nry bowel disease , acquired immune deficiency syn-\\ndrome ( AIDS), bone marrow transplants, and other po-\\ntential diseases and conditions.\\nSome clinical research has reported glutamine aided\\npatients with multiple trauma and burns by helping them\\nfight off infections. It may help AIDS patients put on\\nweight at a much lower cost, and with fewer complica-\\ntions, than human growth hormone. Athletes who over-\\ntrain have higher rates of infectious diseases and aller-\\ngies ; it is thought a diet high in glutamine can help im-\\nprove these athletes’ immune functions.\\nAs more people have begun looking for ways to en-\\nhance fitness, they have turned to protein supplements.\\nIn 2003, it was reported that more than 1.2 million ath-\\nletes used some type of performance-boosting supple-\\nment. Glutamine is used in the fitness industry as a sup-\\nplement for bodybuilders who want to reduce muscle\\nbreakdown, or for recreational athletes on vigorous train-\\ning schedules who feel the supplement fuels their im-\\nmune systems.\\nPreparations\\nAs a protein, glutamine occurs naturally in some\\nfoods, including meat, fish, legumes, peanuts, eggs, tofu,\\nand dairy products. It also is highly concentrated in raw\\ncabbage and beets. Cooking can destroy glutamine, par-\\nticularly in vegetables. Much of a person’s glutamine\\nneeds, even when exercising hard, can come from food\\nsources. A 3–oz serving of meat contains about 3–4\\ngrams of glutamine.\\nGlutamine supplements come in several forms.\\nSome manufacturers sell tablets that also contain antiox-\\nidants (vitamins). The most common forms of glutamine\\nsupplements are protein powders that can be added to\\nliquids and prepared protein drinks and shakes. Another\\namino acid called alanine may be combined with gluta-\\nmine. The combined protein supplement is called alanyl-\\nglutamine. The powder form is probably the most conve-\\nnient and least expensive form of the supplement. When\\nglutamine is used for medical purposes in a hospital set-\\nting, it may be administered via an enteral route, or\\nthrough a tube directly into the intestine.\\nIn 2002, the powder cost about 10 cents a gram,\\nwhile the capsules cost between 12 and 23 cents per\\ngram. Capsules deliver fewer grams of glutamine than the\\npowder and the glutamine in capsules does not absorb as\\nquickly as that in powder. The powder reportedly tastes\\nmild and is not noticeable when added to favorite drinks.\\nRecommended doses of glutamine for fitness uses\\nsuch as bodybuilding vary , but generally are 8–20 grams\\n(g) a day and average about 15 g a day . Cancer patients\\non glutamine therapy may take a higher dose, about 30 g\\na day . An average daily therapeutic dose for the general\\npublic is 1.5–6 g.\\nPrecautions\\nThe powdered form of glutamine should be dis-\\nsolved in a liquid and consumed quickly before it breaks\\ndown. Some literature recommends taking glutamine im-\\nmediately before or after meals, or at the same time as\\neating protein, usually twice per day .\\nGlutamine is marketed as a dietary supplement, and\\ntherefore, the products are not regulated the same as pre-\\nscription drugs.

The monomer is sometimes\\ncalled reduced glutathione, while the dimmer is also\\ncalled oxidized glutathione. The monomer is the active\\nform of glutathione. Oxidized glutathione is broken\\ndown to the single molecule by an enzyme called glu-\\ntathione reductase.\\nGlutathione, in purified extracted form, is a white\\npowder that is soluble in water and in alcohol. It is found\\nnaturally in many fruits, vegetables, and meats. Howev-\\ner, absorption rates of glutathione from food sources in\\nthe human gastrointestinal tract are low .\\nGeneral use\\nGlutathione was first isolated in yeast in 1929. Its\\nmetabolism in the body was described in 1984, and its\\nrole in cancer treatment dates from 1984.\\nGlutathione is a major antioxidant highly active in\\nhuman lungs and many other organ systems and tissues.\\nIt has many reported uses. It has a critical role in protect-\\ning cells from oxidative stress and maintaining the im-\\nmune system. Higher blood levels of glutathione have\\nbeen associated with better health in elderly people, but\\nthe exact association between glutathione and the aging\\nprocess has not been determined.\\nAmong the uses that have been reported for glu-\\ntathione are:\\n• treatment of poisoning, particularly heavy metal poi-\\nsons\\n• treatment of idiopathic pulmonary firbosis\\n• increasing the effectiveness and reducing the toxicity of\\ncis-platinum, a chemo drug used to treat breast cancer\\n• treating Parkinson’s disease\\n• lowering blood pressure in patients with diabetes\\n• increasing male sperm counts in humans and animals\\n• treatment of liver cancer\\n• treatment of sickle cell anemia\\nClaims made about glutathione have included that it\\nwill increase energy , improve concentration, slow aging,\\nand protect the skin.\\nThe importance of glutathione is generally recog-\\nnized, although its specific functions and appropriate\\nclinical use remain under study . Similarly , because in-\\ngested glutathione has little or no effect on intracellular\\nglutathione levels, there are questions regarding the opti-\\nmal method for raising the intracellular levels.\\nIn addition to ongoing studies of the role of glu-\\ntathione in cancer and cancer therapy , there are currently\\nclinical trials of glutathione in Amyotrophic lateral sclero-\\nsis (ALS). The U. S. National Cancer Institute has includ-\\ned glutathione in a study to determine whether nutritional\\nfactors could inhibit development of some types of cancer.\\nEuropean researchers, with support from the Cystic\\nFibrosis Foundation, are examining the potential uses of\\ninhaled glutathione in cystic fibrosis. Some physicians\\nalso use inhaled glutathione in treating airway restriction\\nand asthma. Other studies are investigating whether ad-\\nministration of alpha-lipoic acid, a material that can ele-\\nvate intracellular glutathione, may be beneficial in\\nrestoring the immune system in AIDS patients.\\nPreparations\\nAlthough glutathione is marketed as a nutritional\\nsupplement, it does not appear that glutathione supple-\\nments actually increase the levels of glutathione inside\\ncells. In human studies, oral doses of glutathione had lit-\\ntle effect in raising blood levels . Further, glutathione is\\nso widely distributed in common foods that supplements\\nare not normally required. Supplements of vitamin C\\nare more effective at increasing intracellular glutathione\\nthan taking oral glutathione supplements. Oral supple-\\nments of whey protein and of alpha-lipoic acid appear to\\nhelp restore intracellular levels of glutathione.\\nGlutathione is available as capsules of 50, 100, and\\n250 milligrams. It is also included in many multivitamin\\nand multi-nutrient formulations.\\nPrecautions\\nAt this time, the only established precautions are\\nsensitivity to any of the inactive ingredients in the prepa-\\nrations of glutathione or the products used to stimulate\\nglutathione levels. This is a discussion of glutathione,\\nnot C and whey . There is some new literature that sug-\\ngests supplementing it may be helpful to some cancer\\npatients, but detrimental to others.\\nSide effects\\nThere are no established side effects to glutathione\\nor to the substances used to elevate glutathione levels.\\nT raining & certification\\nGlutathione has been classified as an orphan drug for\\ntreatment of AIDS.

It has\\nbeen used for centuries in the treatment of kidney\\nstones , urinary tract infections , and a variety of other\\nmedical conditions. One legend has it that a 10-year-old\\nboy who received an infusion of goldenrod for several\\nmonths in the late eighteenth century passed 50 gravel\\nstones larger than a pea. Native Americans used golden-\\nrod to alleviate sore throat, and blue mountain tea made\\nfrom goldenrod leaves is sometimes used to combat fa-\\ntigue in the Appalachian Mountains. Goldenrod varieties\\nbelong to the plant family Asteraceae. While European\\ngoldenrod (Solidago virgaurea) is perhaps the most well\\nknown variety , other species of the plant (there are over\\n100 and counting) appear to have roughly equivalent\\nmedicinal properties—in particular, the ability to in-\\ncrease the flow of urine. In Europe, Solidago virgaurea\\nis often used interchangeably with other species of gold-\\nenrod such as Solidago serotina and Solidago canaden-\\nsis in the drug of commerce. Only the aboveground parts\\nof the plant, mainly the flowers and leaves, are consid-\\nered to have medicinal value.\\nGoldenrod grows in Europe, Asia, northern Africa,\\nand North America, but most medicinal goldenrod origi-\\nnates in Bulgaria, Hungary , Poland, and other eastern\\nEuropean countries. It thrives in a wide variety of habi-\\ntats, including hills, woods, meadows, and rocky terrain.\\nContrary to popular belief, goldenrod does not play a\\nsignificant role in triggering hay fever reactions. This\\nmyth probably developed due to the fact that goldenrod\\nblooms around the same time and in the same places as\\nthe ragweed responsible for most seasonal allergies .\\nStudies of goldenrod pollen indicate that it is not a po-\\ntent allergen for most people.

Re-\\nsearch suggests that goldenrod can increase the produc-\\ntion of urine, which is often helpful in cases of urinary\\ntract infection or kidney stones, without reducing levels\\nof important electrolytes, such as sodium and chloride,\\nthe way that some man-made diuretics do. While it is not\\nknown exactly how goldenrod produces its therapeutic\\neffects, researchers have focused on several naturally oc-\\ncurring chemicals in the plant. Most experts believe that\\ngoldenrod’s ability to increase urine production is due to\\nthe presence of flavonoids and saponins, which stimulate\\nthe kidneys to release fluid. Another chemical in golden-\\nrod, a phenolic glycoside called leiocarposide, may be re-\\nsponsible for goldenrod’s anti-inflammatory effects. In\\none study of Solidago virgaurea involving rodents, re-\\nsearchers from Cairo University found that the anti-in-\\nflammatory activity of goldenrod was comparable to that\\nof diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug\\n(NSAID) prescribed for conditions such as rheumatoid\\narthritis.

This versatile herb is sought for its valuable\\nrootstock and inner twig bark. Goldenseal is a member\\nof the Ranunculaceae, or buttercup family . It is a main-\\nstay of Native American medicine , and a popular folk\\nremedy . Goldenseal has multiple uses, both internally\\nand externally . It is sometimes called poor man’s gin-\\nseng. This traditional medicinal herb has been known by\\nmany names, including yellow paint root, orange root,\\neye root, Indian plant, tumeric root, eye balm, jaundice\\nroot, yellow puccoon, and ground raspberry . Native\\nAmerican tribes valued this natural antiseptic herb for\\nmany medicinal uses and as a clothing dye. Early\\ncolonists soon came to appreciate its infection-fighting\\naction. The Native American use of goldenseal as a can-\\ncer treatment was first mentioned in the herbal, Essays\\nT oward a Materia Medica of the United States first pub-\\nlished by Benjamin Smith Barton in 1798.\\nThe yellow rootstock is the main, known medicinal\\npart of the herb. In cultivation, goldenseal requires up to\\nfour years growth before the rootstock is ready for har-\\nvest. The thick and knotty rhizome produces a hairy stem\\nthat grows to 2 ft (61 cm) high. Goldenseal has only two\\nlarge leaves, each five-lobed with double-toothed edges\\ngrowing atop a forked stem. Leaves are serrated at the\\ntop edges. A single flower with greenish-white sepals\\ncrowns the hairy stem. The fruit looks like a raspberry ,\\nhence one of the plant’s common names. Pharmaceutical\\ncompanies harvest goldenseal root in large quantities for\\nuse. The herb is fully endangered on extinction risk lists\\nin the wild due to over-collection of the rhizome. An es-\\ntimated 250,000 pounds of rootstock of this popular\\nherbal remedy are sold each year, and most of this has\\nbeen collected in the wild.\\nGeneral use\\nThe underground portion of the stem, called the rhi-\\nzome, as well as the inner twig bark, are the medicinal\\npart of this multiple-use native remedy . The goldenseal\\nrhizome is rich in alkaloids: hydrastine, berberine, and\\ncanadine, in addition to other phytochemicals, oils, and\\nresin.

It is a bitter herb that is effective when taken inter-\\nnally to promote digestion. The herb is particularly help-\\nful when used to treat inflammation and infection of the\\nmucous membranes lining the upper respiratory tract,\\nand the digestive and genitourinary tract. Its anti-bacteri-\\nal properties improve all catarrhal conditions, and it is\\nhelpful against amoebic infection. Goldenseal potenti-\\nates insulin and stimulates liver, kidney , and lung func-\\ntion. The astringent herb may also be used to help con-\\ntrol bleeding, so it is helpful in circumstances of exces-\\nsive and painful menstruation or postpartum hemor-\\nrhage. It is antiseptic, diuretic, and acts as a mild laxative\\nand internal body cleanser. Goldenseal is used in treat-\\nment of peptic ulcers, and stimulates the flow of bile.\\nApplied externally as rhizome bark powder or tincture,\\nthe herbal preparations can help treat gum disease, vagi-\\nnal infection, eczema, impetigo, conjunctivitis, inflam-\\nmations of the ear, and possibly ringworm. Its diuretic\\nand anti-inflammatory effects can help lower blood pres-\\nsure. The berberine alkaloid in goldenseal stimulates\\nuterine contractions, and the herb is useful to treat pelvic\\ninflammatory disease (PID). Goldenseal is high in\\niron, manganese , silicon, and other minerals. Gold-\\nenseal was once considered a good substitute for qui-\\nnine. The herb has been used as a remedy for diphtheria,\\ntonsillitis , chronic catarrh of the intestines, typhoid\\nfever, gonorrhea , leucorrea, and syphilis . It is no won-\\nder that with all these medicinal benefits, this wonderful\\nherb is disappearing in the wild.\\nPreparations\\nThe rootstock of goldenseal, harvested in spring or\\nfall in the third or fourth year of growth, can be used in\\ndecoction, liquid extract, tablet, and tincture. When pur-\\nchasing commercially prepared remedies, avoid the\\nwild-crafted sources to help protect this valuable herb in\\nits wild habitat.\\nT o prepare an eyewash of goldenseal, mix equal parts\\nof powdered rootstock and boric acid with boiling hot\\nwater. Stir well and allow to cool. Strain the mixture and\\nstore in a dark glass container. For one dosage, retrieve one\\nteaspoon of the resulting liquid per one half cup water as a\\nsoothing eyewash solution. It is important to keep all\\nequipment totally sterile, apply with a sterilized eyedrop-\\nper, and discard old liquid eyewash (over one or two days).\\nFor an infusion, use one teaspoon of powdered root-\\nstock to a pint of boiling water. Let stand until cold.\\nDosage is 1–2 teaspoons, three to six times per day , for up\\nto seven days. The infusion may also be used as a gargle.\\nT o prepare a tincture, combine one part fresh herb to\\nthree parts alcohol (50% alcohol/water solution) in glass\\ncontainer. Set aside in dark place. Shake daily for two\\nweeks. Strain through muslin or cheesecloth, and store in\\ndark bottle. The tincture should maintain potency for two\\nyears. Standard dosage, unless otherwise prescribed, is\\none teaspoon, three times daily , for short periods (one or\\ntwo weeks).\\nT o make capsules, pulverize the dried root into a\\nfine powder. Place in gelatin capsules. Dosage is two\\ncapsules, three times daily for three weeks, then discon-\\ntinue for the next three weeks.\\nPrecautions\\nPregnant and breast-feeding women should not use\\nthis herb as it may stimulate uterine contraction. Patients\\nwith high blood pressure should also avoid goldenseal.\\nThe herb should be taken only for very limited periods,\\nas it builds up in the mucosa of the system and its strong\\nalkaloids are neurotoxic over an extended time (i.e., sev-\\neral months of daily use). Three weeks on and three\\nweeks off is a good routine for dosage. Do not eat the\\nplant fresh, as it can irritate mucous tissues.\\nSide effects\\nGoldenseal use can destroy organisms that are bene-\\nficial to the body , as well as those that are pathological.\\nIt should be used only for limited periods of time.\\nInteractions\\nGoldenseal is often combined with other herbs in\\npreparations. Myrrh gum ( Commiphora myrrha ) and\\nechinacea (Echinacea augustifolia ) extract may be\\nadded to goldenseal in salve preparations. Goldenseal\\ncombines well with mullein (V erbascum thapus ) for\\nearache, and with chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla )\\nand meadowsweet ( Filipendula ulmaria ) for stomach\\naches.

The genitourinary tract is the main system\\nthat is usually affected, but gonorrhea can also spread to\\nthe rectum, the throat, and the eyes. Left untreated, gon-\\norrhea can spread through the bloodstream and infect the\\nbrain, heart valves, joints, and the reproductive system.\\nExposure to an infected mother during birth may cause\\npermanent blindness in the newborn.\\nDescription\\nGonorrhea, commonly referred to as “the clap, ” is\\nthe most prevalent reportable disease in the United\\nStates. Adolescents and young adults are in the highest\\nrisk category , with more than 80% of gonorrhea cases af-\\nfecting the 15–29 year-old age group. Individuals living\\nin urban areas who have multiple sex partners have the\\nhighest risk of contracting the disease. Still, the inci-\\ndence of gonorrhea has been steadily declining since\\n1987. This appears to be largely due to increased public\\nawareness about the risks and prevention of contracting\\nSTDs such as herpes and HIV . However, in 2002, the\\nCenters for Disease Control (CDC) expressed concern\\nabout rising rates of gonorrhea in certain urban areas\\nduring 1999 and 2000. About 650,000 new cases of gon-\\norrhea occur every year in the United States. In particu-\\nlar, rates of gonorrhea were increasing substantially\\namong men who have sex with men.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nGonorrhea is transmitted very efficiently . It can be\\nspread by merely contacting the fluids of an infected per-\\nson as well as by sexual contact. A person runs a\\n60–90% chance of contracting the disease after just one\\nsexual encounter with an infected person. The symptoms\\nusually begin between one day and two weeks after the\\ninitial encounter with the infection.\\nPeople who are infected with gonorrhea commonly\\nexperience increasingly frequent and painful urination, and\\nthe urethra may be painful and swollen. There may be a\\nthick white, yellowish, or bloody discharge from the penis\\nor vagina. Other symptoms may include nausea,\\nvomiting, fever, chills, and pain during intercourse. In the\\ncase of oral infection, there may be a sore throat or pain\\nduring swallowing. An anal infection may cause rectal\\nitching, rectal discharge, and a constant urge to move the\\nbowels. W omen who show symptoms of gonorrhea often\\nhave abdominal pain and breakthrough bleeding (spotting)\\nbetween menstrual periods. However, many women who\\nhave gonorrhea do not experience any symptoms.\\nIn infants and children, irritation, redness, swelling\\nwith a pus-like discharge, and possibly pain and a\\nchange in urination may point to a gonorrhea infection.\\nThe infection may be due to child abuse or exposure to\\ninfected materials. An in-depth history should be taken if\\ngonorrhea is suspected.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe initial diagnosis of gonorrhea will be based on\\nsymptoms, sexual history , and at-risk behavior. One labo-\\nratory test for diagnosis involves the observation of a\\ngram-stained sample of the discharge under a microscope.\\nIn the gram stain test, the sample is dyed, washed with\\nvarious solutions, and dyed with a different color. The\\nfinal color identifies the class of bacteria present in the\\nsample. The advantage of this test is that results can be ob-\\ntained very quickly so that treatment can commence at the\\ninitial visit. In the vast majority of men, it is quite accu-\\nrate; however, the test is not very accurate for women.\\nFor all women and for men with a questionable\\ngram-stain reading, samples of the discharge from the in-\\nfected area can be collected and cultured. The sample is\\nincubated for up to two days, which provides enough\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 859'),\n",

Lactobacillus aci-\\ndophilus in supplements and live-culture yogurts help re-\\nplenish gastrointestinal flora that may be destroyed by\\nthe intake of antibiotics.\\nSeveral herbs may reduce symptoms and help speed\\nhealing. These include kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera and re-\\nlated species), Calendula officinalis, myrrh (Commipho-\\nra molmol ), and Thuja occidentalis. These herbs can be\\ntaken by the mouth or used as a douche. The Chinese\\nherb Coptis chinensis , used for damp-heat infections ,i s\\nhelpful in treating the genitourinary tract, especially if\\npelvic inflammatory disease (PID) develops. An herbal-\\nist should be consulted to make recommendations for fur-\\nther complications. Some recommend a three-day cleans-\\ning fast to quicken and support healing. Fasting should\\nbe done only with the approval and supervision of a\\nphysician. Referral to an acupuncturist is also recom-\\nmended, as there may be acupressure and acupuncture\\npoints that will help with system cleansing.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThe typical treatment for gonorrhea is penicillin or a\\npenicillin derivative, given orally or by injection. If the\\npatient is pregnant or allergic to penicillin, erythromycin\\nmay be substituted. Gonorrhea has become more diffi-\\ncult and expensive to treat since the 1970s because it has\\nbecome increasingly resistant to certain antibiotics. In\\nfact, according to projections from the Centers for Dis-\\nease Control and Prevention, 30% of the strains of gon-\\norrhea were resistant to routine antibiotics in 1994, and\\nresistance has been increasing steadily . Because of this,\\nthe doctor may also prescribe probenecid, which will in-\\ncrease the antibiotic activity .\\nIn 2002, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) up-\\ndated guidelines concerning antibiotics for treating gon-\\norrhea. Resistance of the infection has increased to cer-\\ntain classes of drugs, particularly when gonorrhea was\\ncontracted in certain states, particularly California.\\nGuidelines had already warned against use of these\\ndrugs, called fluoroquinolones, in Hawaii, other Pacific\\nislands, and Asia.\\nSince other STDs, such as chlamydia and syphilis ,\\noften occur with gonorrhea, patients may also be tested\\nand treated for these related infections. Patients should\\nrefrain from sexual intercourse until treatment is com-\\nplete and should return for follow-up testing. Anyone the\\npatient has had sexual contact with during the time of in-\\nfection should be notified and treated, even if those per-\\nsons do not show symptoms. Doctors are required to re-\\nport this disease to public health officials.\\nMore than one health care provider may have to be\\nconsulted. Physicians trained in obstetrics or gynecology\\nmay be involved if gynecological complications occur.\\nMen who experience complications may be referred to a\\nurologist. There are also infectious disease doctors who\\nspecialize in the treatment of infectious diseases, includ-\\ning STDs.\\nExpected results\\nThe prognosis for patients with gonorrhea varies\\nbased on how early the disease is detected and treated.\\nPatients who are treated early and properly can be entire-\\nly cured of the disease. The most common complication\\nis PID. PID can occur in up to 40% of women with gon-\\norrhea and may result in damage to the fallopian tubes,\\nan ectopic pregnancy, or sterility . If an infected woman\\nis pregnant, gonorrhea can be passed on to the eyes of\\nthe newborn during delivery . This can lead to infection\\nand blindness.\\nAlthough the risk of infertility due to gonorrhea is\\nhigher in women than in men, men may also become\\nsterile if urethritis (inflammation of the urethra) devel-\\nops. Complications of gonorrhea can affect the prostate,\\ntesticles, and surrounding glands as well. In either gen-\\nder, inflammation, abscesses, and scarring can occur . In\\napproximately 2% of patients with untreated gonorrhea,\\nthe infection may spread throughout the body and can\\ncause fever, arthritis-like joint pain, and skin lesions.\\nPrevention\\nCurrently , there is no vaccine for gonorrhea. The\\nbest prevention is to abstain from having sex, or to en-\\ngage in sex only when in a mutually monogamous rela-\\ntionship in which both partners have been tested for\\nSTDs. The next line of defense against gonorrhea is the\\nuse of condoms, which have been shown to be highly ef-\\nfective in preventing disease.

Odle\\nGotu kola\\nDescription\\nGotu kola ( Centella asiatica ) is a member of the\\nApiaceae carrot family . It is also called pennywort,\\nmarsh penny , water pennywort, and sheep rot. The name\\nsheep rot comes from the erroneous belief in Europe that\\ngotu kola caused foot rot in sheep. Gotu kola is often\\nmistaken for the kola nut plant ( Cola nitida ). However,\\nthe two are not related and gotu kola, unlike the kola nut,\\ncontains no caffeine . Gotu kola is noted in India as a\\nvery powerful spiritual herb, and A yurvedic medicine\\nrefers to it as Brahmi because it helps obtain knowledge\\nof the spiritual being.\\nGotu kola, a perennial, grows in India, Sri Lanka,\\nMadagascar, South Africa, China, Indonesia, Australia,\\nand North America. It can grow like a weed, but its de-\\nscription depends on its location. For example, in shal-\\nlow water, the leaves float; but in dry areas, the plant de-\\nvelops many roots and thin, tiny leaves. The fan-shaped\\nleaves may be smooth or lobed. Red flowers turn into\\nfruit with a diameter of about 0.2 in (5 mm).\\nGotu kola’s main active components are triter-\\npenoids, although the gotu kola found in India, Sri Lanka,\\nand Madagascar doesn’t have the same properties. Gotu\\nkola’s triterpenes can have a concentration from 1.1-8%,\\nwith most concentrations in the middle range.\\nGotu kola from Madagascar is used for most standard-\\nized extracts, and its four main triterpene properties are:\\n• asiatic acid (29-30%)\\n• madecassic acid (29-30%)\\n• asiaticoside (40%)\\n• madecassoside (1-2%)\\nGotu kola also contains the following.\\nalso reduce the risk of infection.

When\\nother extracts were added to the test tubes, including gotu\\nkola and rosemary, the results were more pronounced.\\nBesides its use as a general memory aid, gotu kola\\nhas become popular in the W estern world for its calming\\neffects as well as for improving concentration. This duali-\\nty occurs because gotu kola affects both the central ner-\\nvous system and the brain. It relaxes the nervous system\\nwhile stimulating the brain to focus better. In a 1999\\nstudy at the W est Palm Beach V eterans Affairs Medical\\nCenter, researchers tested several dietary supplements, in-\\ncluding gotu kola, for use in depression , anxiety , and\\nsleep disorders. Researchers found little difference in the\\nresults of the natural supplements and low- and high-dose\\nantidepressants. However, the studies indicated patients\\nswitch to natural supplements because they think they are\\nsafer. The research served as a guideline for healthcare\\nprofessionals to aid their patients’ choice of treatment.\\nStudies have also shown that gotu kola has positive\\neffects on varicose veins , poor blood circulation in the\\nlegs and the rest of the circulatory system, leg cramps,\\nand leg swelling. The circulatory improvement occurs\\nbecause gotu kola decreases vein hardening, improves\\nthe connective tissue around veins, and helps the blood\\nto flow through veins. These circulatory and leg benefits\\nwere evident in 80% of patients tested in studies con-\\nducted in the late 1980s.\\nGotu kola also has positive effects on various skin\\nproblems. Animal research has shown that tripenoid asi-\\naticoside may help wounds heal quicker. Other studies\\nshowed that gotu kola helped in healing surgical wounds\\nof the ear, nose, and throat, and promoted healing of epi-\\nsiotomies, gangrene , skin grafts, and some skin ulcers.\\nAsiaticoside can also toughen skin, hair, and nails. Re-\\nsearch has shown that asiaticoside may provide treat-\\nment for leprosy . Leprosy-causing bacteria are coated in\\na wax-like substance that the immune system can’t pene-\\ntrate. However, gota kola disintegrates this substance, al-\\nlowing the immune system to attack the bateria.\\nClinical trials also show that gotu kola’s tripenoids,\\nwhen purified, can lessen the ravages of scleroderma.\\nGotu kola can reduce hardening of the skin, decrease\\njoint pain, and increase finger movement.\\nGotu kola extracts can heal second- and third-degree\\nburns from boiling water or gas explosions if the burn is\\ntreated immediately . Either topical application or intra-\\nmuscular injections can stop the effects of skin infec-\\ntions from burns and can stop or reduce skin shrinkage,\\ninflation, and scarring.\\nGotu kola extract might be effective in fighting tu-\\nmors. However, researchers are cautious because animal\\nand human studies need to be completed.\\nPreparations\\nT oday , gotu kola is often eaten in a salad. It can also be\\nmade into a tea by using 0.5–1 tsp (2.5–5 ml) of gotu kola\\nin 1 cup (250 ml) of boiling water. The plant is steeped for\\n10–15 minutes and the tea is then drunk. This amount can\\nbe drunk up to three times a day . Because of its bitter taste,\\nthe tea can be enhanced with honey or lemon to taste.\\nFor a poultice on wounds or skin problems, gotu\\nkola leaves can be crushed and applied, or a tincture may\\nbe used. A poultice can also be made from gotu kola tea.\\nFor scleroderma, suggestions include 70 mg twice a\\nday . The usual dosage is 0.5–1 g three times daily , a stan-\\ndardized extract dosage is 60–120 mg a day , and a liquid\\nextract approximately 0.5–1 teaspoon can be taken daily .\\nPrecautions\\nChildren under two years old, pregnant women, and\\npeople with epilepsy should avoid gotu kola. Fair-\\nskinned people and others who have had an allergic reac-\\ntion to sunlight or other ultraviolet light sources should\\navoid these sources if they take gotu kola.\\nSide effects\\nA rash is the most common side effect when gotu\\nkola is taken internally or applied topically . If injected,\\nsome pain and bruising may occur at the injection sight.\\nThe asiaticoside component could be a mild skin car-\\ncinogen. It is not wise to apply gotu kola topically over a\\nlong period of time. The plant may also cause mild\\nheadaches or nausea. As with any supplement, consulta-\\ntion with a healthcare professional should occur before\\nbeginning treatment.\\nInteractions\\nGotu kola should not be mixed with oral diabetes\\nmedication or drugs such as Lipitor, Lopid, Mevacor,\\nand Zocor, all of which lower cholesterol.

It most commonly affects\\nthe big toe, but may also affect the heel, ankle, hand,\\nwrist, or elbow . It affects the spine often enough to be a\\nfactor in lower back pain. Gout is often a recurring con-\\ndition. An attack usually comes on suddenly and goes\\naway after 5–10 days. Gout occurs when there are high\\nlevels of uric acid circulating in the blood, and the acid\\ncrystallizes and settles in the body . According to the Na-\\ntional Institutes of Health (NIH), gout accounts for about\\n5% of all cases of arthritis reported in the United States.\\nGout appears to be on the increase in the American\\npopulation. According to a study published in November\\n2002, there was a twofold increase in the incidence of\\ngout over the 20 years between 1977 and 1997. It is not\\nyet known whether this increase is the result of improved\\ndiagnosis or whether it is associated with risk factors that\\nhave not yet been identified.\\nDescription\\nUric acid is formed in the bloodstream when the\\nbody breaks down waste products, mainly those contain-\\ning purines. Purines can be produced naturally by the\\nbody , and they can be ingested from such high-purine\\nfoods as meat. Normally , the kidneys filter uric acid par-\\nticles out of the blood and excrete it into the urine. If the\\nbody produces too much uric acid or the kidneys aren’t\\nable to filter enough of it out, there is a buildup of uric\\nacid in the bloodstream. This condition is known as hy-\\nperuricemia.\\nUric acid does not tend to remain dissolved in the\\nbloodstream. Over the course of years, or even decades,\\nhyperuricemia may cause deposits of crystallized uric\\nacid throughout the body . Joints, tendons, ear tips, and\\nkidneys are favored sites. When the immune system be-\\ncomes alerted to the urate crystals, it mounts an inflam-\\nmatory response that includes the pain, redness,\\nswelling, and damage to joint tissue that are the hall-\\nmarks of an acute gout attack.\\nThe body’s uric acid production tends to increase in\\nmales during puberty . Therefore, it should come as no\\nsurprise that nine out of ten of those suffering from gout\\nare men. Since it can take up to 20 years of hyper-\\nuricemia to have gout symptoms, men don’t commonly\\ndevelop gout until reaching their late 30s or early 40s. If\\na woman does develop gout, typically , it will be later in\\nher life. According to some medical experts, this is be-\\ncause estrogen protects against hyperuricemia.

It is caused by high levels of uric acid in the\\nblood, in which urate crystals settle in the tissues of the\\njoints and produce severe pain and swelling. (Illustration by\\nElectronic Illustrators Group. The Gale Group.)\\nuntil estrogen levels begin to fall during menopause that\\nurate crystals can begin to accumulate.\\nHyperuricemia does not necessarily lead to gout.\\nThe tendency to accumulate urate crystals may be due to\\ngenetic factors, excess weight, or overindulgence in the\\nwrong kinds of food. In addition, regular use of alcohol\\nto excess, the use of diuretics, and the existence of high\\nlevels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood can\\nincrease the risk of developing the disease. In some\\ncases, an underlying disease such as lymphoma,\\nleukemia, or hemolytic anemia may also lead to gout.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAn acute episode of gout often starts without warning.\\nThe needle-like urate crystals may be present in the joints\\nfor a long time without causing symptoms. Then, there may\\nbe a triggering event such as a stubbed toe, an infection,\\nsurgery ,stress, fatigue, or even a heavy drinking binge. Pa-\\ntients in intensive care units (ICUs) may have an acute\\nflare-up of gout. In addition, it is now known that chronic\\noccupational exposure to lead leads to decreased excretion\\nof urates and an increased risk of developing gout.\\nIn many cases, the gout attack begins in the middle\\nof the night. There is intense pain, which usually in-\\nvolves only one joint. Often it is the first joint of the big\\ntoe. The inflamed skin over the joint is warm, shiny , and\\nred or purplish, and the pain is often so excruciating that\\nthe sufferer cannot tolerate the pressure of bedcovers.\\nThe inflammation may be accompanied by a fever.\\nAcute symptoms of gout usually resolve in about a\\nweek, and then disappear altogether for months or years at\\na time. Eventually , however, the attacks may occur more\\nfrequently , last longer, and do more damage. The urate\\ncrystals may eventually settle into hard lumps under the\\nskin around the joints, leading to joint deformity and de-\\ncreased range of motion. These hard lumps, called tophi,\\nmay also develop in the kidneys and other internal organs,\\nunder the skin of the ears, or at the elbow . People with\\ngout also face a heightened risk of kidney disease, and al-\\nmost 20% of people with gout develop kidney stones. As\\nof 2002, however, the relationship between gout and kid-\\nney stone formation is still not completely understood.\\nDiagnosis\\nDoctors can diagnose gout based on a physical ex-\\namination and the patient’s description of symptoms. In\\norder to detect hyperuricemia, doctors can administer a\\nblood test to measure serum urate levels. However, high\\nurate levels merely point to the possibility of gout. Many\\npeople with hyperuricemia don’t have urate crystal de-\\nposits. Also, it has been shown that up to 30% of gout\\nsufferers have normal serum urate levels, even at the\\ntime of an acute gout attack. The most definitive way to\\ndiagnose gout is to take a sample of fluid from an affect-\\ned joint and test it for the presence of the urate crystals.\\nT reatment\\nThe symptoms of gout will stop completely a week\\nor so after an acute attack without any intervention. It is\\nimportant, however, to be diagnosed and treated by a\\nhealth care practitioner in order to avoid attacks of in-\\ncreasing severity in the future and to prevent permanent\\ndamage to the joints, kidneys, and other organs. During\\nan acute attack, treatment should focus on relieving pain\\nand inflammation. On an ongoing basis, the focus is on\\nmaintaining normal uric acid levels, repairing tissue\\ndamage, and promoting tissue healing.\\nDiet\\nGenerally , gout is unheard of in vegetarians. It is a\\ncondition that responds favorably to improvements in diet\\nand nutrition. Recurrent attacks can be avoided by main-\\ntaining a healthy weight and limiting the intake of purine-\\nrich foods. A diet high in fiber and low in fat is also rec-\\nommended. Processed foods should be replaced by com-\\nplex carbohydrates, such as whole grains. Protein intake\\nshould be limited to under 0.8g/kg of body weight per day .\\nNutritional supplements\\nVitamin E and selenium are recommended to de-\\ncrease the inflammation and tissue damage caused by the\\naccumulation of urates.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 865'),\n",

Daily doses until the\\nsymptoms have subsided are recommended.\\nColchicine(Colbenemid), is also used. Corticosteroids\\nsuch as prednisone (Deltasone, prednisolone, and corti-\\ncotropin [ACTH]) may be given orally or may be inject-\\ned directly into the joint for a more concentrated effect.\\nBecause these drugs can cause undesirable side effects,\\nthey are used for only about 48 hours so as not to cause\\nmajor problems. Aspirin and other salicylates should be\\navoided, because they can impair uric acid excretion and\\nmay interfere with the actions of other gout medications.\\nOnce an acute attack has been successfully treated,\\ndoctors try to prevent future attacks of gout and long-term\\njoint damage by lowering uric acid levels in the blood.\\nColchicine is the drug of choice to deter recurrence. This\\nmedication can be very hard on the vascular system and\\nthe kidneys, however, and it is incompatible with a num-\\nber of antidepressants, tranquilizers, and antihistamines.\\nIt should be avoided by pregnant women and the elderly .\\nThere are two types of drugs used for lowering uric\\nacid levels. Sometimes these drugs resolve the problem\\ncompletely . However, the use of low-level amounts may\\nbe required for a lifetime. Uricosuric drugs, such as\\nprobenecid (Benemid) and sulfinpyrazone (Anturane),\\ndecrease urates in the blood by increasing their excre-\\ntion. These drugs may also promote the formation of\\nkidney stones, and they are contraindicated for patients\\nwith kidney disease. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors block\\nthe production of urates in the body . They can dissolve\\nkidney stones as well as treat gout. Allopurinol is the\\ndrug most used in this respect. Its adverse effects include\\nreactions with other medications, and the aggravation of\\nexisting skin, vascular, kidney , and liver dysfunction.\\nExpected results\\nGout cannot be cured, but it can be managed success-\\nfully . Prompt attention to diet and reducing uric acid levels\\nwill rectify many of the problems associated with gout.\\nKidney problems can also be reversed or improved.

Frey , PhD\\nPrevention\\nFor centuries, gout has been known as the “rich\\nman’s disease, ” a disease of overindulgence in food and\\ndrink. While this view is perhaps oversimplified, lifestyle\\nfactors clearly influence a person’s risk of developing\\ngout. For example, losing weight and limiting alcohol in-\\ntake can help ward off gout. Since purines are broken\\ndown into urates by the body , consumption of foods high\\nin purine should be limited. Foods that are especially high\\nin purines are red meat, organ meats, meat gravies, shell-\\nfish, sardines, anchovies, mushrooms, cooked spinach,\\nrhubarb, yeast, asparagus, beer, and wine.\\nDehydration promotes the formation of urate crys-\\ntals, so people taking diuretics, or “water pills, ” may be\\nbetter off switching to another type of blood pressure\\nmedication. Increased intake of fluids will dilute the\\nurine and encourage excretion of uric acid. Therefore,\\nsix to eight glasses of water should be consumed daily ,\\nalong with plenty of herbal teas and diluted fruit juices.\\nConsumption of saturated fats impedes uric acid ex-\\ncretion, and consumption of refined carbohydrates, such\\nas sugar and white bread and pasta, increases uric acid\\nproduction. Both should be seriously limited.\\nThe use of vitamin C should be avoided by people\\nwith gout, due to the high levels of acidity .\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nParker, James N., M.D., and Philip M.

It is also known as Guinea\\ngrains, Melegueta pepper, Piper melegueta and Aframo-\\nmum melegueta roscoe,which is its botanical name.\\nAframomum melegueta roscoe is a perennial herb\\nthat produces a spicy edible fruit commonly found in the\\ntropical regions, particularly of western Africa. It is\\nsomewhat palm-like in appearance, forming dense\\nclumps and growing to a height of 4-5 ft (1.2-1.5 m), with\\ndivided smooth leaves that can be up to 9 in (23 cm) long.\\nThere are two types of grains-of-paradise fruit. They\\nresemble the spice cardamom in appearance and pun-\\ngency , and the commercial variety is perhaps even closer\\nin appearance and scent. True grains-of-paradise fruit\\ntends to be less pungent than cardamom once cooked or\\nheated, however.\\nThe seeds are approximately oval in shape, hard,\\nshiny , and reddish-brown color, whereas cardamom is\\npale buff-colored. Powdered grains-of-paradise fruit are\\npale gray . This spice is aromatic and can be distin-\\nguished by its hot peppery taste.\\nGeneral use\\nIn Africa and throughout the tropics, grains-of-par-\\nadise fruit ( Aframomum melegueta ) is a cultivated crop\\nand is used as a remedy for a variety of ailments, al-\\nthough it is now rarely used outside these areas. It is one\\nof the plants extensively made use of by African ethno-\\nmedicine.\\nSome confusion surrounds the identity of the true\\ngrains-of-paradise fruit, as approximately seven species\\nof fruit are also sometimes mistakenly referred to as\\ngrains-of-paradise fruit, particularly Malabar cardamom,\\nCardamomum malabaricum , and Cardamomum minus ,\\nalso the Zanzibar pepper. Grains-of-paradise fruit have\\neven been confused with Nux vomica, which is used as a\\nhomeopathic remedy . In fact, it is now recognized that\\nAframomum melegueta roscoe is the authentic species.\\nThe name “grains-of-paradise fruit” dates from the Mid-\\ndle Ages, and denotes the fact that it was once a highly\\nvalued commodity . The west African coast became\\nknown as the Grain Coast because grains-of-paradise\\nfruit was traded there.\\nConsidered to be spicy , hot, and slightly bitter, the\\nactive constituents of grains-of-paradise fruit include es-\\nsential oils such as gingerol, paradol, and shagaol. It\\nalso contains manganese , gum, tannin, starch, and a\\nbrown resin. It has been proven to be an effective anti-\\nfungal and antimicrobial agent.\\nLike cardamom, it is also used as a condiment, due\\nto its pleasant taste, which is pungent without being in-\\ntensely bitter. It is mainly used nowadays to flavor\\nwines, spirits, and particularly beer, although during the\\nMiddle Ages it was a favorite spice in Europe and other\\nparts of the world. This spice, despite its popular begin-\\nnings, is hardly known outside of Africa today . Never-\\ntheless, it remains popular as a spice in Arab cuisine,\\nparticularly Morocco and Tunisia. It has also been used\\nas a pepper substitute, and may be chewed in cold\\nweather to warm the body . In addition, it is a common\\naddition to veterinary remedies.\\nThe essential oil of grains-of-paradise is available,\\nthough not easy to find. Its properties are similar to those\\nof the fruit, but it is often chosen for its fragrance. Grains-\\nof-paradise fruit is used in African countries as an aphro-\\ndisiac as well as a treatment for measles and leprosy . In-\\nterestingly , extract of Aframomum melegueta has been\\nshown in laboratory studies to increase sexual arousal and\\nbehavior in male rats. It is also used to reduce hemor-\\nrhage, particularly associated with childbirth.\\nOther phytomedicinal uses of grains-of-paradise in-\\nclude as a purgative (strong laxative), galactogogue (to\\nincrease production of breastmilk), anthelmintic (an-\\ntiparasitic—it is effective against worms, etc.), and he-\\nmostatic agent (purifies the blood). It has even been\\nfound to be effective against the dreaded schistosomia-\\nsis, which is a major problem to the medical authorities\\non the African continent.\\nGrains-of-paradise fruit is also effective against in-\\ntestinal infections and infestations, and is also used to\\ncalm indigestion and heartburn . Interestingly , grains-\\nof-paradise fruit is one of the plants presently being re-\\nsearched as a possible alternative to allopathic medicines\\nin tropical countries, where they are attempting to find\\ncheaper and more readily available local phyto-medici-\\nnal alternatives to their common health problems, which\\nare chiefly the effects of tropical diseases. Phyto-medi-\\ncines have often proved to be more effective than syn-\\nthetic agents. In addition they have a more sympathetic\\neffect on the body , and their production is compatible\\nwith current environmental concerns.\\nGrains of paradise are also used in Chinese herbal\\nmedicine, their use being interchangeable with the more\\nreadily available cardamom. It is taken for nausea and\\nvomiting, intestinal discomfort, and pain and discomfort\\nduring pregnancy.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2868\\nGrains-of-paradise fruit\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 868'),\n",

Frey , PhD\\nGrapefruit seed extract\\nDescription\\nGrapefruit seed is prepared in extract form from the\\nseeds, pulp, and white membranes of grapefruits from\\ngrapefruit trees ( Citrus paradisi ). The grapefruit tree,\\nfirst discovered on the Caribbean island of Barbados in\\nthe seventeenth century , was brought to Florida in 1823\\nfor commercial cultivation. The plant was probably\\nnamed grapefruit because its fruits grow in bunches or\\nclusters. Grapefruit seed extract (GSE) is used as a broad\\nspectrum, non-toxic, antimicrobial compound. The ex-\\ntract comes in two forms, liquid and powder.\\nGSE was developed by Dr. Jacob Harich, a physicist\\nwho was born in Y ugoslavia in 1919 and educated in Ger-\\nmany . His education in nuclear physics was interrupted by\\nW ord W ar II. After witnessing the horror of war as a fighter\\npilot, Harich decided to devote the rest of his life to im-\\nproving the human condition. He then expanded his educa-\\ntional pursuits to include medicine, including gynecology\\nand immunology . He came to the United States in 1957 to\\nstudy at Long Island University in New Y ork. As an immu-\\nnologist, he was interested in studying natural substances\\nthat might help protect the body from undesirable microor-\\nganisms. In 1963, he moved to Florida, the heart of grape-\\nfruit country , and began research on the use of grapefruit\\nseeds as a biocide. By 1990, holistic health practitioners\\nbegan to recommend the use of GSE to their patients. In\\n1995, Harich was invited to the Pasteur Institute of France,\\na leading AIDS research center. Researchers at the Center\\nhave been investigating the potential of GSE as a prophy-\\nlactic against the HIV virus as well as against some of the\\nsecondary infections associated with AIDS. He was also\\nhonored by farmers in Europe who use a powdered form of\\nGSE in fish and poultry feed to control Salmonella and Es-\\ncherichia coli. In 1996, Harich passed away .\\nGeneral use\\nGSE is a broad spectrum bactericide, fungicide, an-\\ntiviral, and antiparasitic compound. When used in vitro,\\nGSE has been shown to be highly effective against a\\nPreparations\\nThe fruit is exclusively the part of the plant used,\\ndried, whole, or powdered. The essential oil can also be\\nobtained. The whole grains may be chewed or can be\\nground and incorporated into mixtures.\\nPrecautions\\nAs grains-of-paradise fruit is a name given to so\\nmany other spices, it is advisable to ensure that the cor-\\nrect species is obtained.\\nAframomum melegueta roscoeis included in the FDA ’s\\nlist of botanicals that are generally recognized as safe.\\nSide effects\\nNo side effects have been reported from grains-of-\\nparadise fruit as of 2002; however, this spice is not fre-\\nquently used in the United States. People who are aller-\\ngic to cardamom or ginger should use grains-of-paradise\\nfruit with caution.\\nInteractions\\nAs of 2002, no interactions have been reported with\\nstandard prescription medications.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGrieve, Mrs. M.

The\\npolyphenols are unstable but are chemically converted\\nduring the GSE synthesis process into more stable sub-\\nstances that belong to a class of compounds called quater-\\nnary ammonium compounds. The active quaternary am-\\nmonium compound in GSE believed to be responsible for\\nits antimicrobial properties is a diphenol hydroxybenzene\\ncomplex. The antimicrobial activity appears to develop in\\nthe cytoplasmic membrane of the microorganisms. The\\nactive ingredients disorganize the cytoplasmic membrane\\nso that the uptake of amino acids is prevented. At the\\nsame time there is a leakage of low molecular weight cel-\\nlular contents through the cytoplasmic membrane. Stud-\\nies have also shown that GSE inhibits cellular respiration.\\nThe extract is prepared by grinding grapefruit seeds\\nand pulp into a fine powder. The powder is dissolved into\\npurified water and distilled to remove fiber and pectin. The\\ndistilled slurry is spray dried at low temperatures forming a\\nconcentrated grapefruit bioflavonoid powder. This concen-\\ntrated powder is dissolved in vegetable glycerin and heat-\\ned. Food grade ammonium chloride and ascorbic acid are\\nadded. This mixture is heated under pressure where it un-\\ndergoes catalytic conversion using natural catalysts, in-\\ncluding hydrochloric acid and natural enzymes. The slurry\\nis then cooled, filtered, and treated with ultraviolet light.\\nResidual ammonium chloride in the final product is be-\\ntween 15 and 18%; residual ascorbic acid is between 25\\nand 35 mg/kg. There is no residue of hydrochloric acid in\\nthe final product. In the United States, standardized GSE\\ncontains 60% grapefruit extract materials and 40% veg-\\netable glycerin. A powdered form of GSE is also available\\nthat contains 50% grapefruit extract materials, 30% silicon\\ndioxide, and 20% vegetable glycerine.\\nT o treat infections, 15 drops in 8 oz of water is used.\\nFor diaper yeast infections and as a vaginal douche, 10–15\\ndrops of grapefruit seed extract is used in 4 oz of water.\\nPrecautions\\nGSE has been shown to be non-toxic at levels many\\ntimes greater than the recommended dosages.

Laboratory studies have\\nindicated OPCs are much more effective than vitamin C\\nand vitamin E in neutralizing free oxygen radicals,\\nwhich contribute to organ degeneration and aging in hu-\\nmans. The primary sources of OPCs are pine bark ex-\\ntract and grape seed extract. However, the grape seed ex-\\ntract is more widely recommended for its lower cost and\\nbecause it contains an antioxidant not found in pine bark.\\nGeneral use\\nGrape seed extract is a mixture of complex com-\\npounds. It has a wide range of therapeutic uses, from\\npreventing cancer and cardiovascular disease to alleviat-\\ning symptoms of allergies, ulcers, and cataracts. Its an-\\ntioxidant properties are believed to help slow the aging\\nprocess. Procyanidins, a group of compounds found in\\nthe extract, are thought to increase the effectiveness of\\nother antioxidants, especially vitamin C and vitamin E,\\nby helping them regenerate after neutralizing free radi-\\ncals in the blood and tissue. OPCs in the extract are\\nwater-soluble, making them easily absorbed by the body .\\nThey also are able to cross the stubborn blood-brain bar-\\nrier, providing antioxidant protection to the brain and\\nnervous system. Most of the research on grape seed ex-\\ntract has been done in Europe, so many of its reported\\nbenefits have not been reviewed or approved by the U.S.\\nFood and Drug Administration. It is available as an over-\\nthe-counter supplement. According to V arro E. T yler,\\ndean emeritus of the Purdue University School of Phar-\\nmacy and Pharmacal Sciences, the procyanidin com-\\npounds found in grape seed extract are useful in treating\\nvascular disorders They also are antioxidants, or free-\\nradical scavengers, that help prevent some age-related\\ncancers and atherosclerosis. Grape seed extract is a rela-\\ntively new supplement in the United States, although it\\nhas been used in Europe for several decades. Its antioxi-\\ndant properties were realized in the 1980s with the so-\\ncalled French paradox, in which researchers discovered\\nthat the French had low rates of heart disease even\\nthough their diet was high in cholesterol. This was cred-\\nited to their widespread consumption of red wine. Fur-\\nther research led to the OPCs concentrated in grape\\nseeds. More recent research suggests that grape seed ex-\\ntract may work at the genetic level, activating a gene that\\nstops oxidation of bad cholesterol. A 2003 study found\\nthat grape seed extract worked well in replacing estrogen\\nand blunting hypertension in postmenopausal women.\\nCardiovascular disease\\nEuropean studies have shown procyanidins to be use-\\nful in treating blood vessel disorders, such as fragile cap-\\nillaries and poor circulation in the veins. Components\\nbind to the walls of the capillaries, making them less like-\\nly to break down with the effects of aging. In one Euro-\\npean study , researchers found that treatment with grape\\nseed extract quickly relieved a chronic condition of poor\\ncirculation in the veins. Grape seed extract also has been\\nbeneficial in treating edema, an excessive accumulation\\nof fluid in tissue. Another use of grape seed extract is re-\\nducing blood pressure in people with hypertension. A\\nstudy published in 1998 by cardiovascular researchers at\\nthe University of California, Davis, found that flavonoids\\nin the extract helped increase flow in blood vessels, con-\\ntributing to better regulation of blood pressure.\\nCancer\\nA study published in 1998 by a team of researchers\\nat Creighton University , Georgetown University Medical\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 871\\nGrape seed extract\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 871'),\n",

Other studies have shown grape seed extract, com-\\nbined with other antioxidants, can reduce the overall risk\\nof developing cancer.\\nRespiratory conditions\\nGrape seed extract has been found to be beneficial\\nin treating several respiratory conditions, including asth-\\nma, emphysema , allergies, and sinusitis.

In Europe,\\nOPCs usually are prescribed at 300 mg a day to treat\\nmedical conditions such as varicose veins, edema, aller-\\ngies, inflammation, and skin aging. The extract contains\\nvarying amounts of proanthocyanics, although the label\\nshould indicate about 75–80% proanthocyanidins to be\\neffective. Research in the United States and Europe has\\nshown it is most effective when used in combination\\nwith other antioxidants, especially vitamin C and vita-\\nmin E. Grape seed extract is fully absorbed by the body\\nwithin one hour after consumption. One-half the original\\ndose is still functional within the body after seven hours.\\nIn 2003, a liquid grape seed extract was made avail-\\nable in the United States. This version can be used in a\\nnumber of beverages, including bottled water, without\\nchanging their taste. A 2003 trial at Ohio State Universi-\\nty found that lotions made with grape seed extract helped\\ncuts heal more quickly than they would on their own.\\nThe lotion helped improve blood flow to the wound site.\\nPrecautions\\nThere are no known precautions associated with\\ngrape seed extract. However, persons with serious condi-\\ntions such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease\\nshould not substitute grape seed extract for their existing\\ntreatments without first consulting with their doctor.\\nThere is no clinical evidence that grape seed extract can\\ncure any of these conditions. Since grape seed extract is\\nwater-soluble, any excess intake that is not used by the\\nbody is eliminated in the urine. Studies have shown it is\\nnot carcinogenic, does not cause birth defects, and does\\nnot cause cells to mutate. Pregnant women and those\\nwith autoimmune conditions should probably avoid\\ngrape seed extracts. It is best to check with a clinician to\\nensure the safest dosage is being taken, as reports may\\nvary on the latest research.\\nSide effects\\nNausea and upset stomach have been reported on\\noccasion. More rarely , allergic reactions in the form of\\ntemporary skin rashes have occurred in persons sensi-\\ntive to grape products. There are no reported serious side\\neffects associated with taking grape seed extract. It is\\nnon-toxic, even at high dosages.\\nInteractions\\nThere are no reported negative interactions associat-\\ned with grape seed extract. However, several studies\\ndone in the United States and Europe show the extract\\nhas a positive reaction with vitamin C and vitamin E.\\nStudies have shown that OPCs in grape seed extract are\\nas much as 50 times more potent than those in vitamin E\\nand up to 20 times more potent than OPCs in vitamin C.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBalch, James F .

Generally , the skin of red grapes is used in making\\nnutritional supplements.\\nHistory\\nIn 1535, sailors on Jacques Cartier’s expedition to\\nCanada became seriously ill with scurvy , a vitamin defi-\\nciency . This degenerative disease of connective tissues\\nwas caused by the lack of vitamins in the typical seafar-\\ner’s diet—a menu of dried meat and biscuits. The crew\\nwas saved by the advice of a Native American, who rec-\\nommended drinking tea made from the bark of a particu-\\nlar species of pine tree. In the 1930s, researchers discov-\\nered that the ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in fruits and veg-\\netables prevented scurvy .\\nThe pine extract, however, contained very little vita-\\nmin C. For more than 50 years, European biochemists\\nhave been researching the seafarers’ more likely res-\\ncuer—a family of antioxidant polyphenols (acid com-\\npounds) called pycnogenols, whose primary active com-\\npounds are pigments called oligomeric proanthocyani-\\ndins (OPCs). French chemist Jack Masquelier isolated\\nOPCs from peanut skins in 1947 and coined the term\\n“pycnogenols” to describe the unique class of polyphe-\\nnols to which OPCs belong.\\nAlthough people have been drinking wine for cen-\\nturies, scientific research into the health benefits of prod-\\nucts derived from red grapes began in Europe in the mid\\nto late twentieth century . Supplemental OPCs have been\\nused in Europe since 1950 to treat weak blood capillar-\\nies, postsurgical edema (swelling), cirrhosis (liver dis-\\nease), varicose veins, and diabetic retinopathy (eye dis-\\nease resulting from diabetes). Early identification of\\nOPCs as useful for treating capillary fragility gave re-\\nsearchers some indication of their potential value in con-\\nnective tissue disorders. However, this limited focus\\ntended to overlook the additional therapeutic possibili-\\nties of OPCs and, until the latter part of the twentieth\\ncentury , distracted scientists from investigating broader\\nuses for OPCs.\\nAside from pine bark, OPCs are concentrated in\\ngrape seeds and skins, wine, green and black teas, beans,\\nand the skins of many fruits. Generally , the more intense\\nthe color, the more OPCs in the food, which explains why\\nred wine has a greater health benefit than white wine.\\nWhen red wine is made, the “must” is used—the skins,\\nseeds, and stems. The must is left in the mixture for a long\\nperiod of time as the wine ferments and the OPCs emerge,\\ngiving red wine its characteristic flavor and color.\\nIn the case of white wine, however, the must is taken\\nout early , so the wine neither darkens nor absorbs as\\nmany OPCs. Grape juice also contains OPCs.

Each individ-\\nual must weigh the risks versus the benefits of consum-\\ning alcohol.\\nHowever, resveratrol itself is also a phytoestrogen\\n(plant estrogen). The estrogenic properties of this chemi-\\ncal may play a role in the beneficial cardiovascular ef-\\nfects in red wine.

Oolong and black tea are also\\nproduced from the plant, but are processed and oxidized\\nin different manners. Of the three, green tea contains the\\nhighest levels of polyphenols, the antioxidant substance\\nthat is believed to be beneficial in protecting against both\\ncancer and atherosclerosis.\\nThe tea plant is actually a variation of evergreen bush,\\nwith glossy green leaves and small white to pink flowers.\\nThe plants can reach a height of 30–40 ft (9–12 m) or\\ntaller in the wild, but are generally kept to a height of 6 ft\\n(1.2 m) or less on the tea plantations and gardens where\\nthey are grown in China, Argentina, Japan, India, Indone-\\nsia, Kenya, Malawi, Sri Lanka, Turkey , Pakistan,\\nBangladesh, and T anzania. T ea plants are cultivated in\\ncountries where warm, rainy growing conditions are abun-\\ndant, and are also frequently grown in high altitude areas.\\nWhen tea plants reach maturity at three or four years\\nof age, the young leaves and leaf buds—the parts of the\\nplant highest in polyphenols—are harvested. Green tea is\\nproduced by steaming or roasting the leaves as soon as\\nthey are picked, and then rolling and drying the tea\\nleaves to remove any moisture.\\nGeneral use\\nApproximately 2.5 million tons of tea are grown and\\nproduced worldwide on an annual basis. Written records\\ndate the use of the plant as a beverage since at least the\\ntenth century \\nB.C. in China, and it is thought to be close\\nto 5,000 years old. T ea is the most consumed beverage\\nworldwide (after water). It is also one of the most popu-\\nlar herbal infusions in existence—drunk regularly by\\nover half the world population.\\nThe polyphenols in green tea that act as antioxi-\\ndants may actually inhibit the growth of existing cancer\\ncells. In some animal studies, injections of tea extracts\\nreduced the size of cancerous tumors in animals. The ac-\\ntive agent that is thought to have this effect is an antioxi-\\ndant, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).\\nRecent clinical studies have also indicated that regu-\\nlar use of green tea may reduce the risk of certain types\\nof cancer, including oral, skin, prostate, colon, stomach,\\nand rectal. In one clinical trial, patients with pre-cancer-\\nous mouth lesions who were treated with green and\\nblack tea extracts achieved a 38% decrease in the num-\\nber of pre-cancerous cells. Late in 2001, researchers ac-\\nknowledged one reason for green tea’s anticancer effect,\\nbut further human studies are needed to clearly define its\\nrole in cancer prevention.\\nThe antioxidants in green tea may also be helpful in\\nlowering cholesterol and preventing hardening of the ar-\\nteries and ischemic heart disease . Low flavonoid intake\\nhas been linked to atherosclerosis in several studies. The\\ndata from one 1999 study , which followed more than\\n3,400 tea-drinking residents of Rotterdam, the Nether-\\nlands, concluded that regular, long-term tea consumption\\ncan have a protective effect against severe atherosclerosis.\\nAnother preliminary study published in 1999 in the\\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that green\\ntea extract may increase energy levels and promote fat\\noxidation, and consequently , may be a useful tool in\\nweight control. A recent study , reported on in early 2002,\\nshowed that topically applied green tea extracts can re-\\nduce harmful effects of radiation from the sun. Further\\nstudy might show that green tea polyphenol applications\\ncan help prevent sunburns.\\nIn addition to polyphenols, green tea contains sever-\\nal minerals, including fluoride and aluminum. The fluo-\\nride in green tea may be useful in fighting tooth decay .\\nGreen tea is also an antibacterial agent, and can help to\\nprevent gingivitis and periodontal disease by killing E.\\ncoli and streptococcus bacteria.

It grows natu-\\nrally throughout India and Arabia. Guggul is the gum resin\\nthat comes from this tree, which belongs to the same genus\\nas myrrh and has some similar components and actions.\\nGuggul resin contains steroids, diterpenoids, alipathic es-\\nters, and carbohydrates. These factors appear to work to-\\ngether to exert the beneficial effects of this botanical.\\nGuggul has been traditionally used in A yurvedic\\nmedicine to treat arthritis, inflammation, bone fractures,\\noverweight, and disorders of lipid metabolism. One an-\\ncient A yurvedic reference describes the power of guggul\\nto treat “coating and obstruction of channels. ” This de-\\nscription stimulated further research into the properties of\\nthis botanical medicine for preventing and treating ath-\\nerosclerosis , as well as other conditions resulting from\\nhigh levels of lipids in the body .\\nGeneral use\\nGuggul has been recommended for the treatment of\\narthritis, hypercholesterolemia, nodulocystic acne, and\\noverweight. It is one of the primary therapeutic substances\\nused in A yurvedic medicine to prevent atherosclerosis, as\\nwell as one of the most promising herbs or supplements for\\nthe prevention and treatment of this condition. Studies in\\nanimals have documented not only the protective effects of\\nguggul against atherosclerosis, but have shown actual re-\\ngression of the condition in animals that already had it.\\nThe active portion of the plant is the gum resin,\\nwhich contains guggulsterone, a steroid compound. It ap-\\npears to be effective in lowering blood levels of both total\\ncholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) choles-\\nterol. In trials lasting one to three months, cholesterol lev-\\nels were reduced by 14–27% and triglycerides by\\n22–30%. These results are equal to or better than those of\\nsome conventional medications used to lower cholesterol,\\nbut with fewer side effects. There are several hypotheses\\nto account for the effectiveness of guggul in decreasing\\nserum lipids. It may decrease the production of choles-\\nterol in the liver. Excretion of cholesterol and bile acids\\nare increased, so that less fat and cholesterol are ab-\\nsorbed. Guggul also increases the production of thyroid\\nhormones, which lower the levels of serum lipids. The\\nlowering of serum lipids is what consequently decreases\\nthe risk of atherosclerosis. One of the most important\\nways that gugulipid lowers cholesterol may be by stimu-\\nlating the liver to remove LDLs from the bloodstream.\\nThe effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol\\nis undetermined, as two studies yielded different conclu-\\nsions. T o lower cholesterol, one recommended dose of\\ngugulipid is 100–500 mg taken daily . This dosage con-\\ntains 25 mg of guggulsterone. It may take a month or so\\nfor the full effect to be experienced. Similar doses of\\ngugulipid are used to promote weight loss.\\nThe thyroid gland is stimulated by guggulsterone.\\nThis effect may play a role both in the ability of the sub-\\nstance to decrease cholesterol levels and to promote\\nweight loss by increasing the body’s rate of metabolism.\\nGuggulsterone has significant anti-inflammatory prop-\\nerties, although they are somewhat overshadowed by its ef-\\nfects on lipid metabolism. This finding supports its tradition-\\nal use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritisand other in-\\nflammatory conditions. Studies have shown guggulsterone\\nto be at least as effective as the conventional medications\\nphenylbutazone and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) for both\\nacute and chronic types of inflammation in animal models.\\nPlatelet stickiness appears to be reduced by guggul,\\nwhich is desirable for decreasing the risk of coronary\\nartery disease. Guggul may also promote fibrinolysis\\n(dissolving the fibrin in blood clots ) and act as an an-\\ntioxidant. More research is warranted for these proper-\\nties. They have potential benefits in the prevention of\\nstrokes and embolisms.\\nStudies have shown guggulsterone to have approxi-\\nmately the same effectiveness as the antibiotic tetracy-\\ncline for the treatment of nodulocystic acne. It decreases\\ninflammation and lowers the risk of recurrence of the\\ncondition. Guggul is also thought to have astringent, an-\\ntiseptic, and antisuppurative (preventing pus formation)\\nqualities that lend themselves to the treatment of this se-\\nvere, and sometimes scarring, form of acne.\\nPreparations\\nIn India, guggul has been a standard and approved treat-\\nment for high cholesterol since 1986. Guggul is most often\\navailable in tablet or capsule form, as a purified extract. For-\\nmulations should have a standardized concentration of gug-\\ngulsterone. Most extracts contain from 5–10% gugguls-\\nterone. It is readily available in the United States, but avail-\\nable only by prescription, if at all, in the United Kingdom.\\nGugulipid is also a component of some combination\\nnutritional products that are being promoted for the sup-\\nport of normal metabolism of cholesterol and triglyc-\\nerides. Other components may include inositol hexania-\\ncinate, chromium, and vitamin antioxidants.\\nPrecautions\\nStudies in both humans and animals have demon-\\nstrated a wide margin of safety and negligible toxicity\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 879\\nGuggul\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 879'),\n",

Imagery can be\\nused virtually anywhere, anytime. It is also an equal op-\\nportunity therapy . Although some initial training in the\\ntechnique may be required, guided imagery is accessible\\nto virtually everyone regardless of economic status, edu-\\ncation, or geographical location.\\nGuided imagery also gives individuals a sense of\\nempowerment, or control. The technique is induced by a\\ntherapist who guides the patient. The resulting mental\\nimagery used is solely a product of the individual’s\\nimagination. Some individuals have difficulty imagining.\\nThey may not get actual clear images but perhaps vague\\nfeelings about the guided journey . However, these indi-\\nviduals’ brains and nervous systems responses seem to\\nbe the same as those with more detailed imaginings.\\nPatients who feel uncomfortable “opening up” in a\\ntraditional therapist-patient session may feel more at\\nease with a self-directed therapy like guided imagery .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2880\\nGuided imagery\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAntioxidant—A substance that blocks the destruc-\\ntive action of free radicals.\\nAyurveda —An ancient Indian system of holistic\\nhealing.\\nEmbolism —Obstruction of a blood vessel by a\\nloose clot.\\nFibrinolysis —The breakdown of fibrin, an insolu-\\nble protein that is the end product of blood clot-\\nting.

It can be\\nself-directed, where the individual puts himself into a re-\\nlaxed state and creates his own images, or directed by\\nothers. When directed by others, an individual listens to\\na therapist, video, or audiotaped exercise that leads him\\nthrough a relaxation and imagery exercise. Some thera-\\npists also use guided imagery in group settings.\\nGuided imagery is a two-part process. The first com-\\nponent involves reaching a state of deep relaxation\\nthrough breathing and muscle relaxation techniques. Dur-\\ning the relaxation phase, the person closes her eyes and\\nfocuses on the slow , in and out sensation of breathing. Or,\\nshe might focus on releasing the feelings of tension from\\nher muscles, starting with the toes and working up to the\\ntop of the head. Relaxation tapes often feature soft music\\nor tranquil, natural sounds such as rolling waves and\\nchirping birds in order to promote feelings of relaxation.\\nOnce complete relaxation is achieved, the second\\ncomponent of the exercise is the imagery , or visualization,\\nitself. There are a number of different types of guided im-\\nagery techniques, limited only by the imagination. Some\\ncommonly used types include relaxation imagery , healing\\nimagery , pain control imagery , and mental rehearsal.\\nRelaxation imagery\\nRelaxation imagery involves conjuring up pleasant,\\nrelaxing images that rest the mind and body . These may be\\nexperiences that have already happened, or new situations.\\nHealing imagery\\nPatients coping with diseases and injuries can imag-\\nine cancer cells dying, wounds healing, and the body\\nmending itself. Or, patients may picture themselves\\nhealthy , happy , and symptom-free. Another healing im-\\nagery technique is based on the idea of qi, or energy\\nflow , an idea borrowed from traditional Chinese medi-\\ncine. Chinese medicine practitioners believe that illness\\nis the result of a blockage or slowing of energy flow in\\nthe body . Individuals may use guided imagery to imag-\\nine energy moving freely throughout the body as a\\nmetaphor for good health.\\nPain control imagery\\nIndividuals can control pain through several im-\\nagery techniques. One method is to produce a mental\\nimage of the pain and then transform that image into\\nsomething less frightening and more manageable. An-\\nother is to imagine the pain disappearing, and the patient\\nas completely pain-free. Or, one may imagine the pain as\\nsomething over which he has complete control. For ex-\\nample, patients with back problems may imagine their\\npain as a high voltage electric current surging through\\ntheir spine. As they use guided imagery techniques, they\\ncan picture themselves reaching for an electrical switch\\nand turning down the power on the current to alleviate\\nthe pain.\\nMental rehearsal\\nMental rehearsal involves imagining a situation or\\nscenario and its ideal outcome. It can be used to reduce\\nanxiety about an upcoming situation, such as labor and\\ndelivery , surgery , or even a critical life event such as an\\nimportant competition or a job interview . Individuals\\npicture themselves going through each step of the anxi-\\nety-producing event and then successfully completing it.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 881\\nGuided imagery\\nMartin L.

They are tired, have trouble\\nbreathing, have headaches, sleep poorly , are forgetful,\\nand cannot concentrate. Similar experiences among Gulf\\nW ar veterans have been reported in the United Kingdom\\nand Canada.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThere is much current debate over a possible\\ncausative agent for Gulf W ar Syndrome other than the\\nstress of warfare. Intensive efforts by the V eterans Ad-\\nministration and other public and private institutions\\nhave investigated a wide range of potential factors. These\\ninclude chemical and biological weapons, the immuniza-\\ntions and preventive treatments used to protect against\\nthem, smoke from oil well fires, exposure to depleted\\nuranium, and diseases endemic to the Arabian peninsula.\\nSo far investigators have not approached a consensus.\\nThey even disagree on the likelihood that a specific\\nagent is responsible, as a combination of these risk fac-\\ntors may have negative health consequences. There is,\\nhowever, a likelihood that sarin and/or cyclosarin (nerve\\ngases) were released during the destruction of Iraqi mu-\\nnitions at Kharnisiyah, Iraq, and that these chemicals\\nmight be linked to the syndrome.\\nIn October 1999, the U.S. Pentagon released a re-\\nport that hypothesized that an experimental drug known\\nas pyriostigmine bromide, or PB, might be linked to the\\nphysical symptoms manifested in Gulf W ar Syndrome.\\nThe experimental drug was given to U.S. and Canadian\\ntroops during the war to protect soldiers against the ef-\\nfects of the chemical nerve agent soman.\\nStatistical analysis shows that the following symp-\\ntoms are about twice as likely to appear in Gulf W ar vet-\\nerans than in their non-combat peers: depression , post-\\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic fatigue , cog-\\nnitive dysfunction (diminished ability to calculate, order\\nthoughts, evaluate, learn, and remember), bronchitis ,\\nasthma, fibromyalgia, alcohol abuse, anxiety, and sexu-\\nal dysfunction. PTSD is the modern equivalent of shell\\nshock (term used in W orld W ar I) and battle fatigue\\n(W orld W ar II). It encompasses most of the psychologi-\\ncal symptoms of war veterans, not excluding nightmares,\\npanic at sudden loud noises, and inability to adjust to\\npeacetime living.\\nChronic fatigue syndrome has a specific medical\\ndefinition that attempts to separate common fatigue from\\na more disabling illness in hope of finding a specific\\ncause. Fibromyalgia is another newly defined syndrome,\\nand as such it has arbitrarily rigid defining characteris-\\ntics. These include a certain duration of illness, a speci-\\nfied minimum number of joint and muscle pains located\\nin designated areas of the body , sleep disturbances, and\\nother associated symptoms and signs. One study com-\\nparing unexplained symptoms in Gulf W ar veterans with\\nsymptoms in control subjects found that over half the\\nveterans with unexplained muscle pain met the criteria\\nfor fibromyalgia, and a significant portion of the veter-\\nans with unexplained fatigue met the criteria for chronic\\nfatigue syndrome.\\nAs of 2001, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),\\nwhich is also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease , has been\\nadded to the list of illnesses that occur more frequently\\nin veterans of the Gulf W ar. Gulf W ar veterans are twice\\nas likely as other veterans to develop ALS, which is a\\ndisease that causes wasting of muscle tissue and kills its\\nvictims within three to five years. About 40 Gulf W ar\\nveterans have been diagnosed with ALS; most have al-\\nready died.\\nResearchers have identified three distinct syndromes\\nand several variations in Gulf W ar veterans. T ype one pa-\\ntients suffer primarily from impaired thinking. T ype two\\npatients have a greater degree of confusion and ataxia\\n(loss of coordination). T ype three patients are the most af-\\nfected by joint pains, muscle pains, and extremity pares-\\nthesias (unnatural sensations like burning or tingling in\\nthe arms and legs). In each of the three types, researchers\\nfound different but measurable impairments on objective\\ntesting of neurological function. The functioning of the\\nnervous system is much more complex and subtle than\\nother body systems. Measuring it requires an equally\\ncomplex effort. The tests used in this study carefully\\nmeasured and compared localized nerve performance at\\nseveral different tasks against the same values in normal\\nsubjects. Brain wave response to noise and touch, eye\\nmuscle response to spinning, and caloric testing (stimula-\\ntion of the ear with warm and cold water, which causes\\nvertigo) were clearly different between the normal and\\nthe test subjects. The researchers concluded that there\\nwas “a generalized injury to the nervous system. ” Anoth-\\ner research group concluded their study by stating that\\nthere was “a spectrum of neurologic injury involving the\\ncentral, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems. ”\\nDiagnosis\\nUntil there is a clear definition of the disease, diag-\\nnosis is primarily an exercise in identifying those Gulf\\nW ar veterans who have an undefined illness in an effort\\nto learn more about them and their symptoms.

It is\\ndefined as the inflammation of the structures that sur-\\nround and support the teeth. If left untreated, gum dis-\\nease may progress to the point where there is destruction\\nof the jawbone. It is one of the most common causes of\\ntooth loss. Periodontal disease is also a risk factor for\\ncoronary heart disease and preterm low birth weight.\\nDescription\\nGingivitis is the earliest stage of a gum infection. It\\nmay recur or even become chronic. If gingivitis is not\\ntreated properly , it may progress to periodontitis, an in-\\nflammation of the periodontal ligament that helps hold\\nthe teeth in the bone. Periodontitis is sometimes called\\npyorrhea, which means a pus discharge. Severe cases of\\nperiodontitis may affect the jawbone. A severe case of\\ngum disease that comes on suddenly is a disease known\\nas trench mouth. Trench mouth, or necrotizing ulcerative\\ngingivitis, is also known as V incent’s infection. It is\\ncaused by an infection of both spirochetes and fusiform\\nbacilli. It was once a major problem for soldiers during\\nW orld W ar I. Currently , trench mouth is particularly\\ncommon among teenagers and young adults under\\nstress , often at examination time. Inflammation from\\ntrench mouth can also spread to nearby tissues of the\\nface and neck.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nBy far, the most common cause of gum disease is\\npoor dental hygiene. Regular daily brushing and flossing\\nof the teeth generally clears away food and bacteria\\nbuildup in the mouth. If the teeth are neglected, bacteria\\ncollect, and plaque forms on the teeth and gums. If the\\nplaque is not removed, it mixes with saliva and hardens\\ninto tartar. T artar irritates the gums and causes them to\\nshrink away from the teeth, opening up spaces where\\nmore bacteria and plaque can collect. This cycle encour-\\nages increasingly severe inflammation and infection.\\nThe mechanisms by which bacteria cause tissue de-\\nstruction in advanced gum disease are not fully under-\\nstood. Several bacterial products that diffuse through tis-\\nsue are thought to play a role in gum disease. T oxins pro-\\nduced by some bacteria can kill cells. Studies show that\\nthe amount of endotoxin present correlates with the\\nseverity of periodontal disease. Other bacterial products\\ninclude proteolytic enzymes, which are molecules that\\ndigest protein found in cells, thereby causing cell de-\\nstruction. The human immune response has also been\\nimplicated in tissue destruction. As part of a normal im-\\nmune response, white blood cells enter regions of in-\\nflammation to destroy bacteria. In the process of destroy-\\ning bacteria, periodontal tissue is also destroyed.\\nOther factors can contribute to the development of\\ngum disease. Smokers are more than two times as likely\\nas nonsmokers to develop gum disease. Hormone levels\\ncontribute to the development of bacteria in the mouth.\\nThus pregnancy , puberty , menopause , and the use of\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 885'),\n",

Five grams of amla powder in a cup of\\nwater daily is also recommended.

If the level of\\ntoxins in the body exceeds the liver’s blood-cleansing\\nlimits, eventually the gums (and other parts of the body)\\nbecome a breeding ground for disease. The Chinese also\\nconsider the liver as a reservoir of blood; it ensures that\\nadequate blood and Qi (vital energy) are delivered to the\\nmuscles, gums, and joints.\\nHerbal therapies\\nThe teeth can be brushed with a mixture of baking\\nsoda and hydrogen peroxide to clean them thoroughly\\nand to fight infection. Goldenseal root powder, Hydrastis\\ncanandensis, can be used in the same way . Myrrh, Com-\\nmiphora molmol, can be applied directly to the gums.\\nAloe vera may be applied directly to the gums to reduce\\npain and inflammation. In addition, a cup of water with a\\nteaspoon of apple cider vinegar makes a good daily\\nmouth rinse. An herbal mouth rinse can be prepared from\\n1 oz. hydrastis, 1 oz. myrrh, and 1 pint of water.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nDentists may advise mouth rinses with warm salt\\nwater as well as such measures for symptom relief as\\noral or injectable contraceptives may create a climate\\nthat favors the development of gum disease.

The woody gymnema plant also grows in parts of\\nAfrica. Leaves of this long, slender plant have been used\\nfor more than 2,000 years in India to treat diabetes.\\nGymnema is also known as gurmar, gurmabooti, periplo-\\nca of the woods, and meshasringi (ram’s horn).\\nGeneral use\\nIn the past, powdered gymnema root was used to\\ntreat snake bites, constipation , stomach complaints,\\nwater retention, and liver disease. However, the Hindu\\nword gurmar best describes the primary use of gymne-\\nma. Gurmar means sugar destroyer, and it has been used\\nin A yurvedic medicine for thousands of years to treat\\nadult-onset diabetes, a condition once described as\\n“honey urine. ”\\nGymnema and diabetes\\nDiabetes is a consequence of abnormalities in the\\nblood levels of insulin, the hormone that converts blood\\nsugar into energy . Adult-onset diabetes is caused by the\\nbody’s inability to adequately process insulin. T oday it is\\nknown as T ype II diabetes, non-insulin-dependent dia-\\nbetes mellitus (NIDDM), and stable diabetes.\\nT ype I diabetes, or juvenile diabetes, results from an\\ninsulin shortage. T ype I diabetes is also called insulin-\\ndependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).\\nThousands of years ago, T ype II diabetes was treat-\\ned with gymnema. The plant’s sugar-destroying property\\nwas released when a person chewed on one or two\\nleaves. Gymnema was said to paralyze a person’s tongue\\nto the taste of sugar and bitter tastes. That taste-blocking\\nreaction lasted for several hours. During that time, leaves\\nsupposedly provided a slight block to the taste for salty\\nfoods, while the taste for acidic foods was not affected.\\nBy blocking the taste buds from tasting sugar, gym-\\nnema blocked sugar in the digestive system, resulting in\\na decrease in blood sugar, also known as a hypoglycemic\\neffect. This medicinal action has been studied since the\\nlate 1930s.\\nGymnema has also been used in folk medicine as a\\nremedy for allergies , urinary tract inflections, anemia ,\\nhyperactivity , digestion,cholesterol, and weight control.\\nMost of those treatments did not prove to be effective.\\nGymnema lowers cholesterol slightly , but not enough to\\nbe regarded as a significant remedy .\\nContemporary uses of gymnema\\nCurrently , gymnema is known primarily for its\\nsugar-blocking properties. It is used to treat high blood\\nsugar in diabetics and has been promoted as a weight\\nloss remedy . In India, gymnema has been used by both\\nT ype I and T ype II diabetics, but is used mainly to treat\\nT ype II diabetics.\\nSome clinical trials in India indicated that gymnema\\ncould help with both types of diabetes. During the 1990s,\\nT ype II diabetics in India were studied, and gymnema\\nproved successful for lowering blood sugar with continu-\\nous use for 18 to 24 months. In another study , people di-\\nagnosed as juvenile diabetics took gymnema along with\\ninsulin. In some cases, people were able to reduce their\\ndosages of insulin.\\nIn mid-2002, a U.S. clinical trial was reported to fur-\\nther support gymnema’s use in managing T ype I diabetes.\\nOf those participating in the trial, about 16% were able to\\ndecrease usage of their prescription medication usage.\\nThe same research group also found gymnema beneficial\\nfor non-insulin dependent diabetics. While those results\\nappeared promising, medical professionals caution that\\nmore research is still needed. That research would in-\\nclude double-blind studies and involve more people.\\nA weight-loss remedy?\\nAlthough gymnema won’t make sugary foods taste\\nbad, the sugar destroyer is said to curb the desire for\\nsweets. Due to this sugar-blocking property , gymnema is\\nmarketed as a weight-loss remedy . People could take\\ngymnema to help fight the desire for sweet treats. As a\\nweight-loss remedy , gymnena has not been studied ex-\\ntensively , and some in the medical community were du-\\nbious about its effectiveness, an opinion held as of June\\n2000. Instead, the sugar destroyer is acknowledged as a\\npotential treatment for diabetes.\\nPreparations\\nGymnema is available commercially as a water-sol-\\nuble extract that is standardized to contain 24% gymne-\\nmic acid. The usual dosage of is 400–600 mg of gymne-\\nma per day . However, the strengths of commercial prod-\\nucts can vary . A person taking gymnema should follow\\nthe directions on the package.\\nWhen taken in capsule form, the dosage of gymne-\\nma is one 100-mg capsule taken three to four times daily .\\nGymnema is also available in powdered form.

Also\\nknown as male pattern baldness, it is easily recognized\\nby the distribution of hair loss over the top and front of\\nthe head (leaving a horseshoe pattern of hair) and by the\\nhealthy condition of the scalp. W omen with androgenetic\\nalopecia experience hair thinning, particularly over the\\ntop of the scalp. The disorder is thought to be caused by\\na genetic predisposition that triggers the production of\\ncertain enzymes that convert testosterone into the hor-\\nmone dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

The exact cause of alopecia areata is un-\\nknown, but it is thought to be triggered by an immune\\nsystem disorder.\\nOftentimes, conditions affecting the skin of the\\nscalp will result in hair loss. The first clue to the specific\\ncause is the pattern of hair loss, whether it be complete\\nbaldness ( alopecia capitis totalis ), patchy bald spots,\\nthinning, or hair loss confined to certain areas. Also a\\nfactor is the condition of the hair and the scalp beneath\\nit. Sometimes only the hair is affected; sometimes the\\nskin is visibly diseased as well.\\nFungal infections of the scalp usually cause patchy\\nhair loss. The fungus, similar to the ones that cause athlete’s\\nfoot and ringworm, often glows under ultraviolet light.\\nComplete hair loss is a common result of cancer\\nchemotherapy , due to the toxicity of the drugs used.\\nPlacing a tourniquet around the skull just above the ears\\nduring the intravenous infusion of the drugs may reduce\\nor eliminate hair loss by preventing the drugs from\\nreaching the scalp. However, this technique may not be\\nrecommended in the treatment of certain types of cancer.\\nAn investigational topical gel that may prevent\\nchemotherapy-related hair loss, known as GW 8510, was\\nin clinical trials as of April 2000.\\nSystemic diseases often affect hair growth either se-\\nlectively or by altering the skin of the scalp. One example\\nis thyroid disorders. Hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid\\nhormone) causes hair to become thin and fine. Hypothy-\\nroidism (too little thyroid hormone) thickens both hair\\nand skin. Several autoimmune diseases also affect the skin\\nand potentially the hair, notably lupus erythematosus.\\nHair loss can also be caused by trichotillomania ,a\\nmental disorder or compulsion that causes a person to\\npull out his/her own hair. In some individuals severe\\nmental or physical stress can cause hair loss, including\\nmajor surgery or illness, significant life changes (i.e., di-\\nvorce, death of a loved one), and drastic dietary changes.\\nThis type of hair loss is called T elogen effluvium, and is\\nthe second most common type of hair loss.\\nDiagnosis\\nDermatologists are skilled in diagnosis by sight\\nalone. For more obscure diseases, they may have to re-\\nsort to a skin biopsy , removing a tiny bit of skin using a\\nlocal anesthetic so that it can be examined under a mi-\\ncroscope.

A\\nsurvey found that about 75% of the persons who drank\\nenough to be intoxicated (drunk) sometimes experienced\\nhangover. Although very prevalent, hangovers have not\\nbeen extensively studied. It is known that ethanol is the\\nprimary chemical component of alcohol to produce the\\neffects associated with drinking.\\nWhether hangover affects complex mental tasks and\\nthe performance of simple tasks is unclear. Studies on\\nthese areas have yielded conflicting results, presumably\\ndue to differences in methods. Clearly , alcohol consump-\\ntion can affect sleep, and sleep deprivation is known to\\naffect performance.\\nWhen used continuously for long periods of time, mi-\\nnoxidil produces satisfactory results in about one-quarter\\nof patients with androgenic alopecia and as many as half\\nthe patients with alopecia areata. Both drugs have so far\\nproved to be quite safe when used for this purpose. Side\\neffects of Rogaine include some dryness and irritation of\\nthe scalp. Reported side effects of Propecia include in-\\nfrequent cases of diminished sexual drive and impo-\\ntence . Propecia is not approved for women because it\\ncan cause birth defects.\\nIn 2001, a study was made of immunotherapy with\\ndiphencyprone to treat alopecia areata. A lag of three\\nmonths from start of therapy to development of notice-\\nable hair growth occurred. Researchers noted that the ex-\\ntent of the disease prior to therapy and age at time hair\\nloss began affected treatment success. Patients who were\\nolder at onset of baldness had a better success rate than\\nthose who were younger. The study concluded that long-\\nterm therapy was required for effectiveness.\\nOver the past few decades there have appeared a\\nmultitude of hair replacement methods performed by\\nboth physicians and non-physicians. They range from\\nsimply weaving someone else’ s hair in with the remains\\nof an individual’s own hair to surgically transplanting\\nthousands of hair follicles one at a time.\\nExpected results\\nThe prognosis for individuals with hair loss varies\\nwith the cause. It is generally much easier to lose hair\\nthan to regrow it. Even when it returns, it is often thin\\nand less attractive than the original crop.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 893\\nHangover\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAthlete’ s foot—A fungal infection between the\\ntoes, officially known as tinea pedis.\\nAutoimmune disease—Certain diseases caused by\\nthe body’ s development of an immune reaction to\\nits own tissues.\\nChemotherapy—The treatment of diseases, usual-\\nly cancer , with drugs (chemicals).\\nHair follicles —T iny organs in the skin, each one\\nof which grows a single hair .\\nLupus erythematosus —An autoimmune disease\\nthat can damage skin, joints, kidneys, and other\\norgans.\\nRingworm —A fungal infection of the skin, also\\nknown as tinea corporis.\\nSystemic—Affecting all or most parts of the body .\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 893'),\n",

Hangover is likely caused by a combination of direct\\neffects of ethanol, effects of ethanol removal, effects of\\nethanol breakdown products, effects of other compo-\\nnents of the alcoholic beverage, personal characteristics,\\nand behaviors associated with alcohol use.\\nDirect effects of ethanol\\nEthanol can directly affect the body by causing de-\\nhydration (loss of fluids), electrolyte (body chemicals)\\nimbalance, stomach and intestinal irritation, low blood\\nsugar, and sleep disruption. In addition, alcohol directly\\naffects the circadian rhythm (internal 24-hour clock)\\ncausing a feeling similar to jet lag . Ethanol causes va-\\nsodilation (enlarged blood vessels) and affects bodily\\nchemicals, like serotonin and histamine, which may con-\\ntribute to the headache associated with hangover.\\nEffects of ethanol removal\\nBecause hangover symptoms peak at around the\\nsame time that the blood alcohol concentration falls to\\nzero, some researchers propose that hangover is actually\\na mild form of withdrawal. Excessive drinking causes\\nchanges in the chemical messenger system of the brain\\nand, when the alcohol is removed, the system becomes\\nunbalanced. Many of the symptoms of hangover are sim-\\nilar to those associated with mild withdrawal. Some dif-\\nferences exist, however, between hangover and with-\\ndrawal; specifically , hangover symptoms do not include\\nthe hallucinations, seizures, and the lengthy impairment\\nof withdrawal.\\nEffects of ethanol breakdown products\\nIn the body , ethanol is first broken down to acetalde-\\nhyde and then to acetate. Acetaldehyde is a reactive\\nchemical that, at high concentrations, can cause sweating,\\nrapid pulse, skin flushing, nausea, and vomiting . Some\\nresearchers believe that acetaldehyde causes hangover.\\nAlthough there is no acetaldehyde in the blood when the\\nblood alcohol concentration reaches zero, the toxic ef-\\nfects of acetaldehyde on the body may still persist.\\nOther factors\\nMost alcoholic beverages contain small amounts of\\nother active compounds besides ethanol. These com-\\npounds add to the smell, taste, and appearance of the bev-\\nerage. Gin or vodka, which contain almost pure ethanol,\\nproduce fewer hangover symptoms than alcoholic bever-\\nages that contain other alcohol compounds (such as red\\nwine, brandy , or whiskey). For example, methanol is im-\\nplicated in contributing to hangover. Red wine, whiskey ,\\nand brandy all contain high levels of methanol.\\nSome inherent personal traits place persons at risk\\nof experiencing hangover. In some persons, high levels\\nof acetaldehyde accumulate (because of a deficient en-\\nzyme) which causes them to experience more severe\\nhangovers. Persons who are neurotic, angry , or defen-\\nsive, feel guilty about drinking, experience negative life\\nevents, or have a family history of alcoholism have in-\\ncreased hangover symptoms.\\nCertain behaviors associated with drinking increase\\nthe chance of experiencing hangover. These include drug\\nuse, disruption of normal sleep patterns, restricted food\\nintake, and cigarette use.\\nHangover symptoms begin within several hours after\\na person has stopped drinking and may last up to 24 hours.\\nThe specific symptoms experienced may vary depending\\nupon the individual, the occasion, and the type and\\namount of alcohol consumed. The physical symptoms of\\nhangover include headache, fatigue, light and sound sen-\\nsitivity , muscle aches, eye redness, thirst, nausea, vomit-\\ning, and stomach pain. Hangover can cause rapid heart-\\nbeat, tremor, increased blood pressure, and sweating.\\nMental symptoms associated with hangover are decreased\\nsleep, changes in sleep stages, decreased attention, de-\\ncreased concentration, depression, dizziness, anxiety,i r -\\nritability , and a sense that the room is spinning (vertigo).\\nT reatment\\nEating balanced meals, drinking extra water, and\\nlimiting total alcohol help to reduce or avoid hangover.\\nThere are also many alternative treatments to prevent or\\nreduce hangover symptoms. Drinking additional alcohol\\nto relieve hangover, although it reduces short-term symp-\\ntoms, is not recommended. Some experts believe that\\ndrinking alcohol to relieve hangover is a sign of impend-\\ning alcoholism. The primary measure to fight hangover is\\nto drink plenty of water while drinking alcoholic bever-\\nages, before going to bed, and the day after. Sweating\\nfrom exertion, exercise, sauna, or massage may also help.\\nFood therapy\\nHangover symptoms may be reduced by taking in\\nlots of extra water and fluids and by eating foods that are\\nhigh in vitamin C and the B vitamins, which are be-\\nlieved to speed the removal of alcohol from the body .\\nOranges, guava, grapefruit, and strawberries are rich in\\nvitamin C and beans, fish, and whole grains are rich in\\nthe B vitamins.

It is the branch of yoga that concen-\\ntrates on physical health and mental well-being. Hatha\\nyoga uses bodily postures (asanas), breathing techniques\\n(pranayama ), and meditation (dyana ) with the goal of\\nbringing about a sound, healthy body and a clear, peace-\\nful mind. There are nearly 200 hatha yoga postures, with\\nhundreds of variations, which work to make the spine\\nsupple and to promote circulation in all the organs,\\nglands, and tissues. Hatha yoga postures also stretch and\\nalign the body , promoting balance and flexibility .\\nOrigins\\nY oga was developed in ancient India as far back as\\n5,000 years ago; sculptures detailing yoga positions have\\nbeen found in India which date back to 3000 \\nB.C. Y oga is\\nderived from a Sanskrit word which means “union. ” The\\ngoal of classical yoga to bring self-transcendence, or en-\\nlightenment, through physical, mental, and spiritual\\nhealth. Many people in the W est mistakenly believe yoga\\nto be a religion, but its teachers point out that it is a sys-\\ntem of living designed to promote health, peace of mind,\\nand deeper awareness of ourselves. There are several\\nbranches of yoga, each of which is a different path and\\nphilosophy toward self-improvement. Some of these\\npaths include service to others, pursuit of wisdom, non-\\nviolence, devotion to God, and observance of spiritual\\nrituals. Hatha yoga is the path which has physical health\\nand balance as a primary goal, for its practitioners be-\\nlieve that greater mental and spiritual awareness can be\\nbrought about with a healthy and pure body .\\nThe origins of hatha yoga have been traced back to\\nthe eleventh century \\nA.D. The Sanskrit word ha means\\n“sun” and tha means “moon, ” and thus hatha, or literally\\nsun-moon yoga, strives to balance opposing parts of the\\nphysical body , the front and back, left and right, top and\\nbottom. Some yoga masters (yogis) claim that hatha yoga\\nwas originally developed by enlightened teachers to help\\npeople survive during the Age of Kali, or the spiritual\\ndark ages, in which Hindus believe we are now living.\\nThe original philosophers of yoga developed it as an\\neight-fold path to complete health. These eight steps in-\\nclude moral and ethical considerations (such as honesty ,\\nnon-aggression, peacefulness, non-stealing, generosity ,\\nand sexual propriety), self-discipline (including purity ,\\nsimplicity , devotion to God, and self-knowledge), pos-\\nture, breath control, control of desires, concentration,\\nmeditation, and happiness. According to yogis, if these\\nsteps are followed diligently , a person can reach high\\nlevels of health and mental awareness.\\nAs it has subsequently developed, hatha yoga has\\nconcentrated mainly on two of the eight paths, breathing\\nand posture. Y ogis believe breathing to be the most im-\\nportant metabolic function; we breathe roughly 23,000\\ntimes per day and use about 4,500 gallons of air, which\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2896\\nHatha yoga\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAcetaldehyde —An intermediate product in the\\nbreakdown pathway of ethanol.

For in-\\nstance, power yoga is a recent Americanized version of\\nyoga which takes hatha yoga principles and speeds them\\nup into an extremely rigorous aerobic workout, and\\nmany strict hatha yoga teachers oppose this sort of\\nchange to their philosophy . Other variations of hatha\\nyoga in America now include Iyengar, Ashtanga, Kri-\\npalu, Integral, V iniyoga, Hidden Language, and Bikram\\nyoga, to name a few . Sivananda yoga was practiced by\\nLilias Folen, who was responsible for introducing many\\nAmericans to yoga through public television.\\nIyengar yoga was developed by B.K.S. Iyengar, who\\nis widely accepted as one of the great living yogis.

Thus, breathing is extremely\\nimportant to health, and prana , or life-force, is found\\nmost abundantly in the air and in the breath. If we are\\nbreathing incorrectly , we are hampering our potential for\\noptimal health. Pranayama , literally the “science of\\nbreathing” or “control of life force, ” is the yogic practice\\nof breathing correctly and deeply .\\nIn addition to breathing, hatha yoga utilizes asanas, or\\nphysical postures, to bring about flexibility , balance and\\nstrength in the body . Each of these postures has a definite\\nform and precise steps for achieving the desired position\\nand for exiting it. These postures, yogis maintain, have\\nbeen scientifically developed to increase circulation and\\nhealth in all parts of the body , from the muscular tissues to\\nthe glands and internal organs. Y ogis claim that although\\nhatha yoga can make the body as strong and fit as any ex-\\nercise program, its real benefits come about because it is a\\nsystem of maintenance and balance for the whole body .\\nY oga was brought to America in the late 1800s,\\nwhen Swami V ivekananda, an Indian yogi, presented a\\nlecture on yoga in Chicago. Hatha yoga captured the\\nimagination of the W estern mind, because accomplished\\nyogis could demonstrate incredible levels of fitness, flex-\\nibility , and control over their bodies and metabolism.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 897'),\n",

Patabhi\\nJois, also uses hatha yoga asanas, but places an emphasis\\non the sequences in which these postures are performed.\\nAshtanga routines often unfold like long dances with\\nmany positions done quickly one after the other . Ashtan-\\nga is thus a rigorous form of hatha yoga, and sometimes\\ncan resemble a difficult aerobic workout. Ashtanga\\nteachers claim that this form of yoga uses body heat,\\nsweating, and deep breathing to purify the body .\\nKripalu yoga uses hatha yoga positions but empha-\\nsizes the mental and emotional components of each asana.\\nIts teachers believe that tension and long-held emotional\\nproblems can be released from the body by a deep and\\nmeditative approach to the yoga positions. Integral yoga\\nseeks to combine all the paths of yoga, and is generally\\nmore meditative than physical, emphasizing spirituality\\nand awareness in everyday life. V iniyoga tries to adapt\\nhatha yoga techniques to each individual body and medical\\nproblem. Hidden Language yoga was developed by Swami\\nSivananda Radha, a W estern man influenced by Jungian\\npsychology . It emphasizes the symbolic and psychological\\nparts of yoga postures and techniques. Its students are en-\\ncouraged to write journals and participate in group discus-\\nsions as part of their practice. Bikram yoga has become\\nvery popular in the late 1990s, as its popular teacher,\\nBikram Choudury , began teaching in Beverly Hills and has\\nbeen endorsed by many famous celebrities. Bikram yoga\\nuses the repetition of 26 specific poses and two breathing\\ntechniques to stretch and tone the whole body .\\nBenefits\\nIn a celebrated 1990 study , Dr . Dean Ornish’s Pro-\\ngram for Reversing Heart Disease (Random House), a\\ncardiologist showed that yoga and meditation combined\\nwith a low-fat diet and group support could significantly\\nreduce the blockage of coronary arteries. Other studies\\nhave shown yoga’s benefit in reducing stress-related prob-\\nlems such as high blood pressure and cholesterol. Medita-\\ntion has been adopted by medical schools and clinics as an\\neffective stress management technique. Hatha yoga is also\\nused by physical therapists to improve many injuries and\\ndisabilities, as the gentleness and adaptability of yoga\\nmake it an excellent rehabilitation program.\\nY oga has been touted for its ability to reduce prob-\\nlems with such varying conditions as asthma, backach-\\nes, diabetes, constipation, menopause, multiple sclero-\\nsis, varicose veins , and carpal tunnel syndrome . A\\nvegetarian diet is the dietary goal of yoga, and this\\nchange of lifestyle has been shown to significantly in-\\ncrease longevity and reduce heart disease.\\nY oga as a daily exercise program can improve fitness,\\nstrength, and flexibility . People who practice yoga correctly\\nevery day report that it can promote high levels of overall\\nhealth and energy . The mental component of yoga can clari-\\nfy and discipline the mind, and yoga practitioners say its\\nbenefits can permeate all facets of a person’s life and atti-\\ntude, raising self-esteem and self-understanding. Once indi-\\nviduals learn the basics of yoga, certain poses can be used\\nto help with particular needs, such as improving memory\\nand concentration or reducing bloating and gas after meals.\\nDescription\\nA hatha yoga routine consists of a series of physical\\npostures and breathing techniques. Routines can take\\nanywhere from 20 minutes to two hours, depending on\\nthe needs and ability of the practitioner. Y oga should al-\\nways be adapted to one’s state of health; that is, a shorter\\nand easier routine should be used when a person is fa-\\ntigued. Y oga is ideally practiced at the same time every\\nday , to encourage the discipline of the practice. It can be\\ndone at any time of day; some prefer it in the morning as\\na wake-up routine, while others like to wind down and\\nde-stress with yoga at the end of the day .\\nY oga asanas consist of three basic movements: back-\\nward bends, forward bends, and twisting movements. These\\npostures are always balanced; a back bend should be fol-\\nlowed with a forward bend, and a leftward movement\\nshould be followed by one to the right. Diaphragm breath-\\ning is important during the poses, where the breath begins at\\nthe bottom of the lungs. The stomach should move outward\\nwith the inhalation and relax inward during exhalation. The\\nbreath should be through the nose at all times during hatha\\nasanas. T ypically , one inhales during backward bends and\\nexhales during forward bending movements.\\nThe mental component in yoga is as important as the\\nphysical movements. Y oga is not a competitive sport, but a\\nmeans to self-awareness and self-improvement. An attitude\\nof attention, care, and non-criticism is important; limita-\\ntions should be acknowledged and calmly improved. Pa-\\ntience is important, and yoga stretches should be slow and\\nworked up to gradually . The body should be worked with,\\nand never against, and a person should never overexert. A\\nyoga stretch should be done only so far as proper form and\\nalignment of the whole body can be maintained. Some\\nyoga stretches can be uncomfortable for beginners, and\\npart of yoga is learning to distinguish between sensations\\nthat are beneficial and those that can signal potential injury .\\nA good rule is that positions should be stopped when there\\nis sharp pain in the joints, muscles, or tendons.\\nPreparations\\nAll that is needed to perform hatha yoga is a flat\\nfloor and adequate space for stretching out. A well-venti-\\nlated space is preferable, for facilitating proper breathing\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2898\\nHatha yoga\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 898'),\n",

It has white flowers that look like\\nroses and is considered one of the most beautiful of all\\ntechnique. Y oga mats are available that provide non-slip\\nsurfaces for standing poses. Loose, comfortable clothing\\nshould be worn. Y oga should be done on an empty stom-\\nach; a general rule is to wait three hours after a meal.\\nY oga is an exercise that can be done anywhere and\\nrequires no special equipment. Y oga uses only gravity\\nand the body itself as resistance, so it is a low-impact ac-\\ntivity excellent for those who don’t do well with other\\ntypes of exercise. The mental component of yoga can ap-\\npeal to those who get bored easily with exercise. By the\\nsame token, yoga can be a good stress management tool\\nfor those who prefer movement to sitting meditation.\\nPrecautions\\nAs with any exercise program, people should check\\nwith their doctors before starting yoga practice for the first\\ntime. Those with medical conditions, injuries, or spinal\\nproblems should find a yoga teacher familiar with their\\nconditions before beginning yoga. Pregnant women, par-\\nticularly after the third month of pregnancy, should only\\nperform a few yoga positions with the supervision of an\\nexperienced teacher. Some yoga asanas can be very diffi-\\ncult, and potentially injurious, for beginners, so teachers\\nshould always be consulted as preparation for advanced\\nyoga positions. Certain yoga positions should not be per-\\nformed by those with fevers, or during menstruation.\\nSide effects\\nThose just beginning hatha yoga programs often re-\\nport fatigue and soreness throughout the body , as yoga\\nstretches and exercises muscles and tendons that are\\noften long-neglected. Some yogic breathing and medita-\\ntion techniques can be difficult for beginners and can\\ncause dizziness or disorientation; these are best per-\\nformed under the guidance of a teacher.\\nT raining & certification\\nAt this time, there are no generally accepted standards\\nfor yoga teacher certification in America, unlike in Europe\\nand England, where yoga schools have been standardized.\\nSome schools in America require teachers to study for\\nmany years, while some will grant beginning certificates in\\na much shorter time. When choosing teachers, students\\nshould search for qualities they may require, such as un-\\nderstanding, patience, knowledge of certain medical condi-\\ntions, carefulness, and attention to individual details.\\nY oga classes cost around 10 dollars per session.\\nMany communities, schools, and health organizations\\noffer discounted or free yoga classes as part of health\\nawareness programs.

Mild to moderate heart failure in-\\ncludes patients with heart disease who do not have any\\nlimitations in their physical activities due to the heart\\ndisease. They are comfortable when resting and feel\\nsymptoms such as fatigue, palpitation, shortness of\\nbreath, or angina pain when performing ordinary physi-\\ncal activities.\\nHawthorn has long been used in Europe to treat\\nmild cases of heart failure. In Germany , the Federal In-\\nstitute for Drugs and Medical Devices has approved the\\nuse of hawthorn leaf with flower extracts as a treatment\\nfor New Y ork Heart Association functional stage II heart\\nfailure. The treatment also is listed in the German Phar-\\nmacopeia and approved in the German Commission E\\nmonographs. Several recent studies conducted outside\\nthe United States, primarily in Germany , have studied\\nhawthorn’s effects. In one study , patients who took\\nhawthorn after having moderate heart attacks showed\\nsome improvement compared to patients who took a\\nplacebo; however, this study only lasted eight weeks.\\nOther studies have shown that hawthorn can be used\\nsafely and effectively for congestive heart failure, that it\\ncan improve heart function in patients with chronic heart\\ndisease, and that it compared well with a heart drug\\ncalled Captopril in treating stage II heart disease pa-\\ntients. Most of these studies only lasted eight weeks.\\nIn 2003, a longer trial, consisting of 16 weeks of\\ntreatment of more than 200 patients, showed that use of\\nhawthorn increased exercise capacity and decreased signs\\nand symptoms on heart failure. Hawthorn was slightly\\nmore effective at a higher dose (1,800 mg per day).\\nHawthorn also is taken in liquid form for insomnia\\nand nervous conditions and is used as a gargle for sore\\nthroats. In folk medicine, hawthorn is used as a heart\\ntonic and treatment, to regulate blood pressure, and as a\\nthe shrubs that flower in the spring.

Hay\\nfever can develop at any age, but it shows up most often\\nin childhood through the early 20s. The term “hay fever”\\nis not quite accurate, since the pollen of hay grasses is\\nonly one of the many possible allergens involved, and\\nthere is no fever. Although an allergy to pollen does not\\nappear to be inherited, the tendency to allergic sensitivity\\nin general may run in families.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nOf all the causes of allergies , pollen is one of the\\nmost widespread. Trees, weeds, and grasses produce\\npollen in large amounts for seed production. These pol-\\nlens are dispersed by the wind, and many never reach the\\nintended targets. Instead, they are inhaled through the\\nnose and throat. Different plants release their pollen at\\ndifferent times of the year, so the timing of hay fever\\nsymptoms varies from person to person, depending on\\nwhich plants provoke a response.\\nFor people with hay fever, inhaled pollen grains are\\nidentified by the body as foreign invaders. This is proba-\\nbly due to a dysfunction in the immune system. The mast\\ncells of the immune system act as storage containers for\\nhighly reactive chemical granules, including histamine.\\nAllergens trigger a release of these granules, and the mast\\ncells spill their chemicals into neighboring blood vessels\\nand nerve cells. Histamine dilates the blood vessels, caus-\\ning fluids to escape into surrounding tissues. This results\\nin swelling, pooling of fluid in the tissues, and redness of\\nthe nose and eyes. Histamine also stimulates pain recep-\\ntors, and causes the itchiness and discomfort of the nose,\\neyes, and throat that are common hay fever symptoms.\\nInflammation of the nose, or rhinitis, is the major\\nsymptom of hay fever. Inflammation causes itching ,\\nsneezing, runny nose, redness, and tenderness. Swelling\\nof the sinuses can constrict the eustachian tube that con-\\nnects the inner ear to the throat, causing a feeling of con-\\ngestion and popping in the ears. Mucus from the sinuses\\nmay run down the back of the throat, leading to throat ir-\\nritation and redness. Seasonal fatigue and sinus\\nheadaches may also be indications of hay fever, as well\\nas respiratory congestion and a decreased sense of smell.\\nSevere allergies can lead to dark circles under the eyes,\\npuffy eyelids, and creases under the eyes. Characteristi-\\ncally , children with hay fever may push their noses up-\\nward with the palm of their hand or twitch their noses to\\nclear the congestion.\\nV irtually any type of tree or grass may cause hay\\nfever, although plants with showy flowers usually pro-\\nduce a sticky pollen that is much less likely to become\\nairborne. Among North American plants, weeds are the\\nmost prolific producers of allergenic pollen. Ragweed is\\nthe major culprit, but other plant pollens that routinely\\naffect hay fever sufferers include sagebrush, lamb’s-\\nquarter, Russian thistle, and English plantain . Grasses\\ninclude timothy grass, Kentucky bluegrass, Johnson\\ngrass, Bermuda grass, redtop grass, orchard grass, and\\nsweet vernal grass. Trees that produce allergenic pollen\\ninclude oak, ash, elm, hickory , pecan, box elder , and\\nmountain cedar.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of hay fever is usually simple. A thor-\\nough history of the illness is important in diagnosing al-\\nlergies, including whether the symptoms vary according\\nto time of day or the season, and possible exposures.\\nWhen symptoms always appear during a particular sea-\\nson and disappear with the onset of cold weather, hay\\nfever is almost certainly the culprit. For a more definitive\\ndiagnosis, a skin prick test is used, in which a diluted ex-\\ntract of the suspected allergen is injected superficially or\\nscratched into the skin and the reaction is observed. An-\\nother test is a provocative challenge, which is performed\\nby putting an extract of the suspected allergen onto the\\nconjunctiva of the eye or in the nose or lungs. When such\\ndirect skin testing is not possible, various methods of\\ntesting the blood may be used. Other conditions causing\\nrhinitis, such as infection, may have to be ruled out by a\\nnasal smear, in which a sample of mucus is taken on a\\nswab for examination.\\nT reatment\\nAlternative treatments for hay fever often focus on\\nmodulation of the body’s immune response. They fre-\\nquently center around diet and lifestyle adjustments.

The\\nmedical term for headache is cephalalgia.\\nDescription\\nHeadaches are divided into two large categories, prima-\\nry and secondary , according to guidelines established by the\\nInternational Headache Society (IHS) in 1988 and revised\\nfor republication in 2004. Primary headaches—accounting\\nfor more than 90% of all headaches— are not caused by an\\nunderlying medical condition. There are three major types of\\nprimary headaches: migraine, cluster, and tension. Sec-\\nondary headaches are caused by another disease or medical\\ncondition, and account for fewer than 10% of headaches.\\nRebound headaches, also known as analgesic abuse\\nheadaches, are a subtype of primary headache caused by\\noveruse of headache drugs. They may be associated with\\nmedications taken for tension or migraine headaches.\\nSecondary headaches are classified as either traction\\nor inflammatory headaches. Traction headaches result\\nfrom the pulling, pushing, or stretching of pain-sensitive\\nstructures, such as a brain tumor pressing upon the outer\\nlayer of tissue that covers the brain. Inflammatory\\nheadaches are caused by infectious diseases of the ears,\\nteeth, sinuses, or other parts of the head.\\nHeadaches are very common in the North American\\nadult population. The American Council for Headache\\nEducation (ACHE) estimates that 95% of women and\\n90% of men in the United States and Canada have had at\\nleast one headache in the past 12 months. Most of these\\nare tension headaches. Migraine headaches are less com-\\nmon, affecting about 11% of the population in the Unit-\\ned States and 15% in Canada. Several studies indicate\\nthat doctors tend to underdiagnose migraine headaches;\\nthus the true number of patients with migraines may be\\nconsiderably higher than the reported statistics. Cluster\\nheadaches are the least common type of primary\\nheadaches, affecting about 0.4% of adult males in the\\nUnited States and 0.08% of adult females. Cluster\\nheadaches occur most commonly in adults between the\\nages of 20 and 40.\\nIt is possible for patients to suffer from more than\\none type of headache. For example, patients with chronic\\ntension headaches often have migraine headaches as well.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nCauses\\nA person feels headache pain when specialized\\nnerve endings, known as nociceptors, are stimulated by\\npressure on or injury to any of the pain-sensitive struc-\\ntures of the head.

The parts of\\nthe head that are sensitive to pain include the skin that\\ncovers the skull and upper spine; the 5th, 9th, and 10th\\ncranial nerves, and the nerves that supply the upper part\\nof the neck; and the large arteries located at the base of\\nthe brain, as well as those that supply the membranes\\ncovering the brain and spinal cord.\\nT ension headaches typically result from tightening of\\nthe face, neck, and scalp muscles as a result of emotional\\nstress; physical postures that cause the head and neck mus-\\ncles to tense (e.g., holding a phone against the ear with one’s\\nshoulder); emotional depression or anxiety; temporo-\\nmandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction; or arthritis of the neck.\\nThe tense muscles put pressure on the walls of the blood\\nvessels that supply the neck and head, which stimulates the\\nnociceptors in the tissues that line the blood vessels.\\nThe causes of migraine headaches have been debat-\\ned since the 1940s. Some researchers think that mi-\\ngraines are the end result of a magnesium deficiency in\\nthe brain, or of hypersensitivity to a neurotransmitter\\n(brain chemical) known as dopamine. Another theory is\\nthat certain nerve cells in the brain become unusually ex-\\ncitable, setting off a chain reaction that leads to changes\\nin the amount of blood flowing through the blood vessels\\nand stimulation of their nociceptors. Specific genes asso-\\nciated with migraines were recently discovered. This\\nfinding suggests that genetic mutations may be responsi-\\nble for the abnormal excitability of the nerve cells in the\\nbrains of patients with migraine headaches.\\nAs of 2004, little is known about the causes of clus-\\nter headaches or changes in the central nervous system\\nthat produce them. Patients with cluster headaches are\\nadvised to quit smoking and minimize their use of alco-\\nhol because nicotine and alcohol appear to trigger these\\nheadaches.

A drop of more than 10 dB in the level of sound a\\nperson can hear is significant.\\nSound travels as waves through a medium like air or\\nwater. These waves are collected by the external ear and\\ncause the tympanic membrane (eardrum) to vibrate. The\\nchain of ossicles (tiny bones) connected to the\\neardrum—the incus, malleus, and stapes—carries the vi-\\nbration to the oval window (an opening to the inner ear),\\nincreasing its amplitude 20 times on the way . There, the\\nenergy causes a standing wave in the watery liquid (en-\\ndolymph) inside the organ of Corti. (A standing wave is\\none that does not move.) The frequency of the sound de-\\ntermines the configuration of the standing wave. Many\\nthousands of tiny nerve fibers detect the highs and lows\\nof the standing wave and transmit their findings to the\\nbrain, which interprets the signals as sound.\\nT o summarize, sound energy passes through the air\\nof the external ear, the bones of the middle ear, and the\\nliquid of the inner ear. It is then translated into nerve im-\\npulses, sent to the brain through nerves, and understood\\nthere as sound. It follows that there are five steps in the\\nhearing process:\\n• air conduction through the external ear to the eardrum\\n• bone conduction through the middle ear to the inner ear\\n• water conduction to the organ of Corti\\n• nerve conduction into the brain\\n• interpretation by the brain\\nHearing can be interrupted in a variety of ways at\\neach of the five steps.\\nThe external ear canal can be blocked with ear wax,\\nforeign objects, infection, and tumors. Overgrowth of the\\nbone can also narrow the passageway , making blockage\\nand infection more likely . This condition can occur when\\nthe ear canal has been flushed with cold water repeatedly\\nfor years, as is the case with surfers, for whom the condi-\\ntion called “surfer’s ear” is named.\\nThe eardrum is so thin a physician can see through it\\ninto the middle ear. It can be ruptured by sharp objects,\\npressure from an infection in the middle ear, or even a\\nfirm cuffing or slapping of the ear . The eardrum is also\\nsusceptible to pressure changes during scuba diving.\\nSeveral conditions can diminish the mobility of the\\nsmall bones (ossicles) in the middle ear. Otitis media, an\\ninfection in the middle ear, occurs when fluid cannot es-\\ncape into the throat because the eustachian tube is\\nblocked. The fluid (pus or mucus) that accumulates pre-\\nvents the ossicles from moving as efficiently as they nor-\\nmally do, thus dampening the sound waves. In a disease\\ncalled otosclerosis, spongy tissue grows around the bones\\nNINDS, <http://www .ninds.nih.gov/health_and_medical/\\npubs/headache_htr>.\\nNINDS. “Migraine Information Page. ” Bethesda, MD: NINDS,\\n2003. <http://www .ninds.nih.gov/health_and_medical/\\npubs/migraineupdate.htm>.\\nRebecca J.

Y et in most lan-\\nguages, consonants provide us the clues needed for de-\\ntermining what a person is saying. So these people hear\\nplenty of noise, they just cannot easily make out what it\\nmeans. They have particular trouble differentiating\\nspeech from background noise.\\nBrain infections such as meningitis , drugs such as\\nthe aminoglycoside antibiotics (streptomycin, gen-\\ntamycin, kanamycin, tobramycin), and Meniere’s disease\\ncan also cause permanent sensory hearing loss. Meniere’s\\ndisease combines attacks of hearing loss with attacks of\\nvertigo. The symptoms may occur together or separately .\\nHigh doses of salicylates such as aspirin and quinine can\\ncause a temporary high-frequency loss, and prolonged\\nhigh doses can lead to permanent deafness. There is also\\na hereditary form of sensory deafness and a congenital\\nform most often caused by rubella (German measles).\\nSudden hearing loss of at least 30 dB in less than\\nthree days is most commonly caused by cochleitis, a\\nmysterious viral infection.\\nThe final category of hearing loss is neural hearing\\nloss. Permanent neural hearing loss most often results from\\ndamage to the acoustic nerve and the parts of the brain that\\nof the inner ear. This growth sometimes binds the stapes\\nin the oval window , which interferes with its normal vi-\\nbration and causes deafness. All the conditions mentioned\\nso far—those that occur in the external and middle ear—\\nare causes of what is known as conductive hearing loss.\\nThe second category , sensory hearing loss, refers to\\ndamage to the organ of Corti and the acoustic nerve. Pro-\\nlonged exposure to loud noise is the leading cause of senso-\\nry hearing loss. A million people have this condition, many\\nidentified during the military draft and rejected as being\\nunfit for duty . The cause is often believed to be prolonged\\nexposure to rock music. Occupational noise exposure is the\\nother leading cause of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL)\\nand is ample reason for wearing ear protection on the job.\\nMore unusual, but often undetected, is low-frequen-\\ncy hearing loss. Scientists discovered in 2001 that people\\nwith a particular gene mutation gradually lose their abili-\\nties to hear low-frequency sounds. Since those people\\nwith this type of hearing loss can still distinguish speech,\\nthey often remain unaware of the low-frequency changes\\nin their hearing.

Strokes, multiple sclerosis, and acoustic\\nneuromas are all possible causes of neural hearing loss.\\nHearing can also be diminished by tinnitus, which is\\ncharacterized by extra sounds generated by the ear. These\\nsounds are referred to as tinnitus, and can be ringing,\\nblowing, clicking, or anything else that no one but the pa-\\ntient hears. Tinnitus may be caused by loud noises, med-\\nication, allergies, or medical conditions—from the same\\nkinds of disorders that can cause diminished hearing.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany common causes of hearing loss can be detect-\\ned through an examination of the ears and nose com-\\nbined with simple hearing tests performed in the physi-\\ncian’s office. An audiogram (a test of hearing at a range\\nof sound frequencies) often concludes the evaluation.\\nThese simple tests often produce a diagnosis. If the de-\\nfect is in the brain or the acoustic nerve, further neuro-\\nlogical testing and imaging will be required.\\nThe audiogram has many uses in diagnosing hearing\\ndeficits. The pattern of hearing loss across the audible fre-\\nquencies gives clues to the cause. Several alterations in the\\ntesting procedure can give additional information. For ex-\\nample, speech is perceived differently than pure tones. Ad-\\nequate perception of sound combined with inability to rec-\\nognize words points to a brain problem rather than a senso-\\nry or conductive deficit. Loudness perception is distorted\\nby disease in certain areas but not in others. Acoustic neu-\\nromas often distort the perception of loudness.\\nT reatment\\nConductive hearing loss can be treated with alterna-\\ntive therapies that are specific to the particular condition.\\nNutritional therapy\\nThe following dietary changes may help improve\\ncertain hearing impairment conditions:\\n• Alleviate accumulated wax in the ear by taking oral\\nsupplements with essential fatty acids such as flax oil\\nand omega-3 oil.\\n• Identify and avoid potential allergenic foods. Children\\nwho are allergic to foods have an increased risk of get-\\nting chronic ear infections.\\n• T ake nutritional supplements. B-complex vitamins and\\niron supplements may be helpful in preventing protein\\ndeficiency and anemia . These conditions depress im-\\nmune function and increase the risk of chronic ear in-\\nfections. Children suffering from frequent ear infec-\\ntions may need supplementation with strong antioxi-\\ndants such as vitamins A and C, zinc , and\\nbioflavonoids. High-potency multivitamin and mineral\\nsupplements should contain most of these helpful nutri-\\nents as well as other essential vitamins and minerals.\\nHerbal therapy\\nThere are several effective herbal treatments for\\nhearing impairments. They include:\\n• Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo may be effective in patients with\\nhearing loss who often complain of ringing in the ears.\\n• Natural antibiotics such as echinacea and goldenseal\\ncan help prevent or treat ear infections.\\n• Certain Chinese herbal combinations can help alleviate\\ntinnitus, ear infections, and chronic sinus infections\\nthat can lead to hearing loss.\\nHomeopathy\\nHomeopathic therapies may help patients who have\\nsensory hearing loss. An experienced homeopathic\\nphysician will prescribe specific remedies based on\\nknowledge of the underlying cause.\\nAcupuncture\\nAcupuncture may be able to improve hearing in\\nsome patients with sensory-neural deafness. It may be\\nused to improve the circulation of fluids in the head that\\nlead to chronic congestion and noises.\\nOther therapies\\nOther therapies that may help improve hearing in\\nsome patients include A yurvedic medicine , cran-\\niosacral therapy, and auditory integration training.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nConductive hearing loss can almost always be re-\\nstored to some degree, if not completely .\\n• Matter in the ear canal can easily be removed, with a\\ndramatic improvement in hearing.\\n• Surfer’s ear gradually regresses if the patient avoids\\ncold water or uses a special ear plug. In advanced\\ncases, surgeons can grind away the excess bone.\\n• A middle-ear infection involving fluid is also simple to\\ntreat. If medications do not work, fluid may be surgi-\\ncally drained through the eardrum, which heals com-\\npletely after treatment.\\n• Traumatically damaged eardrums can be repaired with\\na tiny skin graft.\\n• Otosclerosis may be surgically repaired through an op-\\nerating microscope.

(Photograph by J.L. Carson, Custom Medical\\nStock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)\\nDescription\\nHeart attack is the leading cause of death in the\\nUnited States. Approximately every 29 seconds one\\nAmerican will have a heart attack, and once a minute\\none American will die from a heart attack. More than 1.5\\nmillion Americans suffer a heart attack every year, and\\nalmost half a million die, according to the American\\nHeart Association. Most heart attacks are the end result\\nof years of silent but progressive coronary artery disease,\\nwhich can be prevented in many people. A heart attack is\\noften the first symptom of coronary artery disease. Ac-\\ncording to the American Heart Association, 63% of\\nwomen and 48% of men who died suddenly of coronary\\nartery disease had no previous symptoms. Heart attacks\\nare also called myocardial infarctions (MIs).\\nA heart attack occurs when one or more of the coro-\\nnary arteries that supply blood to the heart are complete-\\nly blocked and blood to the heart muscle is cut off. The\\nblockage is usually caused by atherosclerosis, the build-\\nup of plaque in the artery walls, and/or by a blood clot in\\na coronary artery . Sometimes, a healthy or atherosclerot-\\nic coronary artery has a spasm and the blood flow to part\\nof the heart decreases or stops. Why this happens is un-\\nclear, but it can result in a heart attack.\\nAbout half of all heart attack victims wait at least\\ntwo hours before seeking help. This increases their\\nchance of sudden death or being disabled. The longer the\\nartery remains blocked during a heart attack, the more\\ndamage will be done to the heart. That is why it is impor-\\ntant to recognize the signs of a heart attack and seek\\nprompt medical attention at the nearest hospital with 24-\\nhour emergency cardiac care.\\nAbout one fifth of all heart attacks are silent, that is,\\nthe victim does not know one has occurred. Although the\\nvictim feels no pain, silent heart attacks can still damage\\nthe heart.\\nThe outcome of a heart attack also depends on\\nwhere the blockage is, whether the heart rhythm is dis-\\nturbed, and whether another coronary artery supplies\\nblood to that part of the heart. Blockages in the left coro-\\nnary artery are usually more serious than in the right\\ncoronary artery . Blockages that cause an arrhythmia, an\\nirregular heartbeat, can cause sudden death.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nHeart attacks are generally caused by severe coro-\\nnary artery disease. Most heart attacks are caused by\\nblood clots that form on atherosclerotic plaque. This\\nblocks a coronary artery from supplying oxygen-rich\\nblood to part of the heart. A number of factors increase\\nthe risk of developing coronary artery disease.\\nMajor risk factors significantly increase the risk of\\ncoronary artery disease. Those that cannot be changed are:\\n• Heredity . People whose parents have coronary artery\\ndisease are more likely to develop it as well. African\\nAmericans are also at increased risk, due to their higher\\nrate of severe hypertension than whites.\\n• Gender. Men under the age of 60 years of age are more\\nlikely to have heart attacks than women of the same\\nage.\\n• Age. Men over the age of 45 and women over the age\\nof 55 are considered at risk. Older people (those over\\n65) are more likely to die of a heart attack. Older\\nwomen are twice as likely to die within a few weeks of\\na heart attack than men. This may be because of other\\nco-existing medical problems.\\nMajor risk factors that can be changed are:\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 915'),\n",

Smoking greatly increases both the chance of\\ndeveloping coronary artery disease and the change of\\ndying from it. Smokers have two to four times the risk\\nof non-smokers of sudden cardiac death and are more\\nthan twice as likely to have a heart attack. They are also\\nmore likely to die within an hour of a heart attack.\\n• High cholesterol. Cholesterol is a soft, waxy substance\\nthat is produced by the body , as well as obtained from\\neating foods such as meat, eggs, and other animal prod-\\nucts. Cholesterol level is affected by age, sex, heredity ,\\nand diet. Risk of developing coronary artery disease in-\\ncreases as blood cholesterol levels increase. T otal cho-\\nlesterol of 240 mg/dL and over poses a high risk, and\\n200–239 mg/dL a borderline high risk. In LDL choles-\\nterol, high risk starts at 130–159 mg/dL, depending on\\nother risk factors. HDL (healthy cholesterol) can lower\\nor raise the coronary risk also.\\n• High blood pressure. High blood pressure makes the\\nheart work harder, and over time, weakens it. It increas-\\nes the risk of heart attack, stroke , kidney failure, and\\ncongestive heart failure. A blood pressure of 140 over\\n90 or above is considered high. As the numbers in-\\ncrease, high blood pressure goes from Stage 1 (mild) to\\nStage 4 (very severe). When combined with obesity ,\\nsmoking, high cholesterol, or diabetes, the risk of heart\\nattack or stroke increases several times.\\n• Lack of physical activity . This increases the risk of\\ncoronary artery disease. Even modest physical activity\\nis beneficial if done regularly .\\n• Use of certain drugs or supplements. Extreme caution\\nis advised in the use of the herbal supplement ephedra.\\nThe supplement, which was marketed for weight loss\\nand to improve athletic performance, was found to con-\\ntribute to heart attack, seizure, stoke and death. In April\\n2003, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\\ninvestigating controlling or banning the substance.\\nWhile it was once believed that hormone replacement\\ntherapy (HR T) helped prevent heart disease in women,\\na large clinical trial called the W omen’s Health Initia-\\ntive found the opposite to be true. In 2003, the FDA\\nbegan requiring manufacturers of HRT to place warn-\\nings on the box listing adverse effects of estrogen, in-\\ncluding increased risk of heart attack, stroke and blood\\nclots. The labels also must mention that HR T should\\nnot be used as a preventive medicine for heart disease.\\nContributing risk factors\\nContributing risk factors have been linked to coro-\\nnary artery disease, but their significance and prevalence\\nare not known yet. Contributing risk factors are:\\n• Diabetes mellitus. The risk of developing coronary\\nartery disease is seriously increased for diabetics. More\\nthan 80% of diabetics die of some type of heart or\\nblood vessel disease.\\n• Obesity . Excess weight increases the strain on the\\nheart, increases blood pressure and blood cholesterol,\\nand increases the risk of developing coronary artery\\ndisease, even if no other risk factors are present. In fact,\\nnew research in 2002 shows that losing weight also re-\\nduces inflammation of the arteries in obese women,\\nwhich is a risk factor equal to that of high cholesterol.\\n• Stress and anger. Some scientists believe that stress\\nand anger can contribute to the development of coro-\\nnary artery disease. Stress increases the heart rate and\\nblood pressure, and can injure the lining of the arteries.\\nMore than 60% of heart attack victims experience\\nsymptoms before the heart attack occurs. These sometimes\\noccur days or weeks before the heart attack. Sometimes,\\npeople do not recognize the symptoms of a heart attack or\\nare in denial that they are having one. Symptoms are:\\n• Uncomfortable pressure, fullness, squeezing, or pain in\\nthe center of the chest. This lasts more than a few min-\\nutes, or may go away and return.\\n• Pain that spreads to the shoulders, neck, or arms.\\n• Chest discomfort accompanied by lightheadedness,\\nfainting, sweating, nausea, or shortness of breath.\\nAll of these symptoms do not occur with every heart\\nattack. Sometimes, symptoms disappear and then reap-\\npear. A person with any of these symptoms should im-\\nmediately call an emergency rescue service or be driven\\nto the nearest hospital emergency room.\\nDiagnosis\\nExperienced emergency care personnel can usually\\ndiagnose a heart attack simply by looking at the patient.\\nT o confirm this diagnosis, they talk with the patient,\\ncheck heart rate and blood pressure, perform an electro-\\ncardiogram, and take a blood sample. The electrocardio-\\ngram shows which coronary artery is blocked. Electrodes\\ncovered with conductive jelly are placed on the patient’s\\nchest, arms, and legs. They send impulses of the heart’s\\nactivity through an oscilloscope (a monitor) to a recorder,\\nwhich traces them on paper. The blood test shows the\\nleak of enzymes or other biochemical markers from dam-\\naged cells in the heart muscle. In 2003, the FDA cleared a\\nnew test for ruling out heart attacks in people who come\\nto emergency rooms with severe chest pains. It is the first\\nnew blood test for evaluation of heart attacks since 1994\\nand is used along with an electrocardiogram.\\nT reatment\\nHeart attacks are treated with cardiopulmonary re-\\nsuscitation (CPR) when necessary to start and keep the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2916\\nHeart attack\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:24 PM  Page 916'),\n",

Oxygen is often used to ease the heart’s\\nworkload or to help a victim of a severe heart attack\\nbreathe easier. If oxygen is used within hours of the heart\\nattack, it may help limit damage to the heart.\\nAlternative therapies aim at preventing the progres-\\nsion of heart disease that leads to a heart attack. Changes\\nin lifestyle can also prevent second heart attacks.\\nHerbal medicine offers a variety of remedies that\\nmay have a beneficial effect on coronary artery disease.\\nOats ( Avena sativa ), garlic (Allium sativum ), and gug-\\ngul( Commiphora mukul ) may help reduce cholesterol;\\nlinden ( Tilia europaea) and hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)\\nare sometimes recommended to control high blood pres-\\nsure, a risk factor for heart disease. T ea (Camellia sinen-\\nsis), especially green tea, is high in antioxidants, which\\nstudies have shown may have a preventative effect\\nagainst atherosclerosis. A 2003 study found that black\\ntea may reduce the risk of a heart attack by as much as\\n43% and that black tea’s protective effects are even\\ngreater in women than in men.\\nNutritional therapies have been shown to prevent\\ncoronary artery disease and stop, or even reverse, the pro-\\ngression of atherosclerosis. A low-fat, high-fiber diet is\\noften recommended. It is essential to reduce the amount of\\nmeat and animal products consumed, as they are high in\\nsaturated fats. Whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables,\\nlegumes, and nuts are recommended. V itamin and mineral\\nsupplements that reduce, reverse, or protect against coro-\\nnary artery disease include chromium; calcium and mag-\\nnesium; B complex vitamins; the antioxidant vitamins B\\nand E; L-carnitine; and zinc. These protective effects even\\nwork in the elderly , according to a 2003 report. A study re-\\nvealed that those age 65 and older who ate the most cereal\\nand bread fiber were 21% less likely to develop heart dis-\\nease than those who ate the least. They also were less like-\\nly to have a heart attack or stroke.\\nY ogaand other bodywork, massage,relaxation thera-\\npies, aromatherapy, and music therapymay also help by\\nreducing stress and promoting physical and mental well-\\nbeing. A 1996 study in the United Kingdom found that par-\\nticipants who practiced t’ai chi had a resulting lowering in\\nblood pressure. By evoking the body’s relaxation response\\nthrough meditation and deep breathing, blood pressure,\\nmetabolic rate, and hearth rate can all be reduced.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nAdditional treatment after a heart attack can include\\nclose monitoring, electric shock, drug therapy , re-vascu-\\nlarization procedures, percutaneous transluminal coro-\\nnary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery .\\nDrugs to stabilize the patient and limit damage to\\nthe heart include thrombolytics, aspirin, anticoagulants,\\npainkillers and tranquilizers, beta-blockers, ace-in-\\nhibitors, nitrates, rhythm-stabilizing drugs, and diuretics.\\nThrombolytic drugs that break up blood clots and enable\\noxygen-rich blood to flow through the blocked artery in-\\ncrease the patient’s chance of survival if given as soon as\\npossible after the heart attack. These include anisoylated\\nplasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC)\\nor anistreplase (Eminase), recombinant tissue-type plas-\\nminogen activator (r-tP A, Retevase, or Activase), and\\nstreptokinase (Streptase, Kabikinase).\\nT o prevent additional heart attacks, aspirin and an\\nanticoagulant drug often follow the thrombolytic drug.\\nThese prevent new blood clots from forming and exist-\\ning blood clots from growing. Anticoagulant drugs help\\nprevent the blood from clotting. The most common anti-\\ncoagulants are heparin and warfarin. Heparin is given in-\\ntravenously while the patient is in the hospital; warfarin,\\ntaken orally , is often given later. Aspirin helps to prevent\\nthe dissolved blood clots from reforming.\\nT o relieve pain, a nitroglycerine tablet taken under\\nthe tongue may be given. If the pain continues, morphine\\nsulfate may be prescribed. Tranquilizers such as di-\\nazepam (V alium) and alprazolam (Ativan) may be pre-\\nscribed to lessen the trauma of a heart attack.\\nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and\\ncoronary artery bypass surgery are invasive revascular-\\nization procedures which open blocked coronary arteries\\nand improve blood flow . They are usually performed\\nonly on patients for whom clot-dissolving drugs do not\\nwork, or who have poor exercise stress tests, poor left\\nventricular function, or ischemia. Generally , angioplasty\\nis performed before coronary artery bypass surgery .\\nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ,\\nusually called coronary angioplasty , is a non-surgical\\nprocedure in which a catheter (a tiny plastic tube) tipped\\nwith a balloon is threaded from a blood vessel in the\\nthigh or arm into the blocked artery . The balloon is in-\\nflated and compresses the plaque to enlarge the blood\\nvessel and open the blocked artery . The balloon is then\\ndeflated and the catheter is removed. Coronary angio-\\nplasty is successful about 90% of the time. For one third\\nof patients, the artery narrows again within six months\\nafter the procedure. The procedure can be repeated.

People\\nwho survive a heart attack have a chance of sudden death\\nthat is four to six times greater than others and a chance\\nof illness and death that is two to nine times greater.\\nOlder women are more likely than men to die within a\\nfew weeks of a heart attack.\\nNew statistics released in early 2002 revealed that\\nabout half of all deaths from heart disease happen before\\nthe patient can get to the hospital.

The study\\nauthors said that improved prevention and recognition of\\nthe warning symptoms of heart attack could lower the\\nnumber of sudden deaths.\\nPrevention\\nMany heart attacks can be prevented through a\\nhealthy lifestyle, which can reduce the risk of developing\\ncoronary artery disease. For patients who have already\\nhad a heart attack, a healthy lifestyle and carefully fol-\\nlowing doctor’s orders can prevent another heart attack.\\nA heart healthy lifestyle includes eating right, regular ex-\\nercise, maintaining a healthy weight, no smoking, mod-\\nerate drinking, no illegal drugs, controlling hypertension,\\nand managing stress.\\nA healthy diet includes a variety of foods that are\\nlow in fat (especially saturated fat), low in cholesterol,\\nand high in fiber; plenty of fruits and vegetables; and\\nlimited sodium . Saturated fat raises cholesterol, and, in\\nexcessive amounts, it increases the amount of the pro-\\nteins in blood that form blood clots. Polyunsaturated and\\nmonounsaturated fats are relatively good for the heart.\\nFat should comprise no more than 30 percent of total\\ndaily calories. In 2002, new evidence suggested that a\\ndiet rich in lutein, the pigment found in dark green leafy\\nvegetables, helps artery walls fight plaque and lessens\\nrisk of heart attack.\\nCholesterol should be limited to about 300 mg per\\nday . Many popular lipid-lowering drugs can reduce\\nLDL-cholesterol by an average of 25–30% when com-\\nbined with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. Soluble fiber\\ncan also help lower cholesterol. Fruits and vegetables are\\nrich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and they are low\\ncalorie and nearly fat free. Vitamin C and beta-carotene,\\nfound in many fruits and vegetables, keep LDL-choles-\\nterol from turning into a form that damages coronary ar-\\nteries. Excess sodium can increase the risk of high blood\\npressure, and daily intake should be limited to 2,400\\nmg—about the amount in a teaspoon of salt.\\nRegular aerobic exercise can lower blood pressure,\\nhelp control weight, and increase HDL (“good”) choles-\\nterol. Moderate intensity aerobic exercise lasting about\\n30 minutes four or more times per week is recommended\\nfor maximum heart health, according to the Centers for\\nDisease Control and Prevention and the American Col-\\nlege of Sports Medicine. Three 10-minute exercise peri-\\nods are also beneficial. Aerobic exercise—activities such\\nas walking, jogging, and cycling—uses the large muscle\\ngroups and forces the body to use oxygen more efficient-\\nly . It can also include everyday activities such as active\\ngardening, climbing stairs, or brisk housework.\\nMaintaining a desirable body weight is also impor-\\ntant. About one quarter of all Americans are overweight,\\nand nearly one-tenth are obese, according to the Surgeon\\nGeneral’s Report on Nutrition and Health. People who are\\n20% or more over their ideal body weight have an in-\\ncreased risk of developing coronary artery disease. Losing\\nweight can help reduce total and LDL cholesterol, reduce\\ntriglycerides, and boost relative levels of HDL cholesterol.\\nSmoking has many adverse effects on the heart. It\\nincreases the heart rate, constricts major arteries, and can\\ncreate irregular heartbeats. It also raises blood pressure,\\ncontributes to the development of plaque, increases the\\nformation of blood clots, and causes blood platelets to\\ncluster and impede blood flow . Heart damage caused by\\nsmoking can be repaired by quitting—even heavy smok-\\ners can return to heart health. Several studies have shown\\nthat ex-smokers face the same risk of heart disease as\\nnon-smokers within five to 10 years of quitting.\\nDrinking should be done in moderation. Modest\\nconsumption of alcohol can actually protect against\\ncoronary artery disease. This is believed to be because\\nalcohol raises HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels in some\\npatients.

When the blockage\\ncuts off the blood flow , the result is heart attack (myocar-\\ndial infarction or heart muscle death).\\nHealthy coronary arteries are open, elastic, smooth,\\nand slick. The artery walls are flexible and expand to let\\nmore blood through when the heart needs to work hard-\\ner. The disease process is thought to begin with an injury\\nto the linings and walls of the arteries. This injury makes\\nthem susceptible to atherosclerosis and production of\\nblood clots (thrombosis).\\nCauses & symptoms\\nHeart disease is usually caused by atherosclerosis.\\nCholesterol and other fatty substances accumulate on\\nthe inner wall of the arteries. They attract fibrous tissue,\\nblood components, and calcium . They then harden into\\nartery-clogging plaques. Atherosclerotic plaques often\\nform blood clots that can also block the coronary arteries\\n(coronary thrombosis). Congenital defects and muscle\\nspasms of arteries or heart muscles also block blood\\nflow . Recent research indicates that infection from or-\\nganisms such as chlamydia bacteria may be responsible\\nfor some cases of heart disease.\\nA number of major contributing risk factors increase\\nthe chance of developing heart disease. Some of these can be\\nchanged and some cannot. The greater the number of risk\\nfactors, the greater the chance of developing heart disease.\\nMajor risk factors\\nMajor risk factors significantly increase the chance\\nof developing heart disease. These include:\\n• Heredity . People whose parents have heart disease are\\nmore likely to develop it. African-Americans are also at\\nincreased risk because they experience a high rate of\\nsevere hypertension.\\n• Gender. Men are more likely to have heart attacks than\\nwomen and to have them at a younger age. Over the\\nage of 60, however, women have heart disease at a rate\\nequal to that of men.\\n• Age. Men who are 45 years of age and older and\\nwomen who are 55 years of age and older are more like-\\nly to have heart disease. Occasionally , heart disease may\\nstrike men or women in their 30s. People over 65 are\\nmore likely to die from a heart attack. Older women are\\ntwice as likely as older men to die within a few weeks\\nof a heart attack.\\n• Smoking. Smoking increases both the chance of devel-\\noping heart disease and the chance of dying from it.\\nSmokers are more than twice as likely as nonsmokers\\nto have a heart attack and are two to four times more\\nlikely die from it.\\nblood to the heart. It is caused by atherosclerosis, an ac-\\ncumulation of fatty materials on the inner linings of ar-\\nteries that restricts blood flow . When the blood flow to\\nthe heart is completely cut off, the result is a heart at-\\ntack because the heart is starved of oxygen.\\nDescription\\nHeart disease, also called coronary heart disease or\\ncoronary artery disease, is the leading cause of death for\\nboth men and women in the United States. According to\\nthe American Heart Association, deaths from coronary\\nartery disease have declined somewhat since about 1990,\\nbut more than 40,000 people still died from the disease\\nin 2000. About 13 million Americans have active symp-\\ntoms of coronary artery disease.\\nHeart disease occurs when the coronary arteries be-\\ncome partially blocked or clogged. This blockage limits\\nthe flow of blood through the coronary arteries, the\\nmajor arteries supplying oxygen-rich blood to the heart.\\nThe coronary arteries expand when the heart is working\\nharder and needs more oxygen. If the arteries are unable\\nto expand, the heart is deprived of oxygen (myocardial\\nischemia ).

Dietary sources of cholesterol\\nare meat, dairy food, eggs, and other animal fat prod-\\nucts. It is also produced by the body . Age, body fat,\\ndiet, exercise, heredity , and sex affect one’s blood cho-\\nlesterol. T otal blood cholesterol is considered high at\\nlevels above 240 mg/dL and borderline at 200-239\\nmg/dL. High-risk levels of low-density lipoprotein\\n(LDL cholesterol) begin at 130-159 mg/dL, depending\\non other risk factors. Risk of developing heart disease\\nincreases steadily as blood cholesterol levels increase\\nabove 160 mg/dL.\\n• High blood pressure. High blood pressure makes the\\nheart work harder and weakens it over time. It increas-\\nes the risk of heart attack, stroke , kidney failure, and\\ncongestive heart failure. A blood pressure of 140 over\\n90 or above is considered high. The risk of heart attack\\nor stroke is raised several times for people with high\\nblood pressure combined with obesity , smoking, high\\ncholesterol levels, or diabetes.\\n• Lack of physical activity . Lack of exercise increases the\\nrisk of heart disease. Even modest physical activity ,\\nlike walking, is beneficial if done regularly .\\n• Diabetes mellitus. The risk of developing heart disease is\\nseriously increased for diabetics. More than 80% of dia-\\nbetics die of some type of heart or blood vessel disease.\\nContributing risk factors\\nContributing risk factors have been linked to heart\\ndisease, but their significance is not known yet. Con-\\ntributing risk factors are:\\n• Obesity . Excess weight increases the strain on the heart\\nand increases the risk of developing heart disease even\\nif no other risk factors are present. Obesity increases\\nblood pressure and blood cholesterol and can lead to\\ndiabetes.\\n• Hormone replacement therapy (HR T). Even though\\nphysicians once believed that HRT could help prevent\\nheart disease in women, the W omen’s Health Initiative\\n(WHI) released information in 2002 and 2003 showing\\nthat use of combined hormones (estrogen and prog-\\nestin) is harmful in women who already have coronary\\nartery disease.\\n• Stress and anger. Some scientists believe that poorly\\nmanaged stress and anger can contribute to the devel-\\nopment of heart disease and increase the blood’s ten-\\ndency to form clots (thrombosis). Stress increases the\\nheart rate and blood pressure and can injure the lining\\nof the arteries.\\n• Chest pain (angina). Angina is the main symptom of\\ncoronary heart disease but it is not always present.\\nOther symptoms include shortness of breath, chest\\nheaviness, tightness, pain, a burning sensation, squeez-\\ning, or pressure either behind the breastbone or in the\\nleft arm, neck, or jaws. According to the American\\nHeart Association, 63% of women and 48% of men\\nwho died suddenly of heart disease had no previous\\nsymptoms of the disease.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis begins with a visit to the physician, who\\nwill take a medical history , discuss symptoms, listen to\\nthe heart, and perform basic screening tests. These tests\\nwill measure blood lipid levels, blood pressure, fasting\\nblood glucose levels, weight, and other indicators. Other\\ndiagnostic tests include resting and exercise electrocar-\\ndiograms, echocardiography , radionuclide scans, and\\ncoronary angiography . The treadmill exercise (stress)\\ntest is an appropriate screening test for those with high\\nrisk factors even though they feel well.\\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart’s ac-\\ntivity and may reveal a lack of oxygen (ischemia). Elec-\\ntrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the\\npatient’s chest, arms, and legs. They send impulses of the\\nheart’s activity through an oscilloscope (a monitor) to a\\nrecorder that traces them on paper. Another type of elec-\\ntrocardiogram, known as the exercise stress test, mea-\\nsures how the heart and blood vessels respond to exer-\\ntion when the patient is exercising on a treadmill or a sta-\\ntionary bike. Both tests can be performed in a physi-\\ncian’s office or outpatient facility .\\nEchocardiography , or cardiac ultrasound, uses sound\\nwaves to create an image of the heart’s chambers and\\nvalves. A technician applies gel to a hand-held transduc-\\ner, then presses it against the patient’s chest. The heart’s\\nsound waves are converted into an image that can be dis-\\nplayed on a monitor. The test does not reveal the coro-\\nnary arteries themselves but can detect abnormalities in\\nthe heart wall caused by heart disease. T ypically per-\\nformed in a doctor’s office or outpatient facility , the test\\ntakes 30-60 minutes.\\nRadionuclide angiography enables physicians to see\\nthe blood flow of the coronary arteries. Nuclear scans are\\nperformed by injecting a small amount of a radiophar-\\nmaceutical, such as thallium, into the bloodstream. As\\nthe patient lies on a table, a camera that uses gamma rays\\nto produce an image of the radioactive material passes\\nover the patient and records pictures of the heart. Ra-\\ndionuclide angiography is usually performed in a hospi-\\ntal’s nuclear medicine department.

Coen-\\nzyme Q10 has been shown to be beneficial for 70% of\\npatients with congenitive heart failure. According to Dr.\\nElson Haas, taurine, an amino acid found in meat and\\nfish proteins, is used to treat heart arrhythmia. T wo\\ngrams three times a day for people with congestive heart\\nfailure showed improved cardiovascular functions.\\nY ogaand other bodywork, massage, relaxation,a r o -\\nmatherapy , and music therapies may also help prevent\\nheart disease and stop, or even reverse, the progression of\\natherosclerosis. V itamin and mineral supplements that re-\\nduce, reverse, or protect against heart disease include B-\\ncomplex vitamins, calcium, chromium, magnesium,L -\\ncarnitine, zinc, and the antioxidant vitamins C and E. The\\neffectiveness of vitamins C and E is still under debate,\\nand physicians caution that they be used in moderation.\\nT raditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may recom-\\nmend herbal remedies, massage, acupuncture , and di-\\netary modification. A healthy diet (including cold water\\nfish as a source of essential fatty acids) and exercise are\\nimportant components of both alternative and conven-\\ntional prevention and treatment strategies.\\nNew reports on diet and heart disease have answered\\nsome questions, but others remain unclear. While one\\nstudy concludes that four servings per day of fruit and\\nvegetables are associated with a slight drop in risk of\\nheart disease, eight or more servings per day can produce\\na significant drop in risk. Another study showed that con-\\nsuming legumes at least four times per week lowered risk\\nof heart disease from 11% to 22% compared with con-\\nsuming legumes less than once a week. Research on an-\\ntioxidants continues to send mixed messages, with some\\nreports showing that vitamins E, C, and other antioxi-\\ndants can help prevent heart disease, and other studies\\nshowing they have no effect. Many physicians and re-\\nsearchers therefore recommend that those wanting to fol-\\nlow healthy heart habits continue to eat a diet rich in an-\\ntioxidants but recognize that there is probably no value in\\nadding antioxidant supplements to a good diet.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nHeart disease can be treated in many ways. The\\nchoice of treatment depends on the patient and the sever-\\nity of the disease. Treatments include lifestyle changes\\nand drug therapy , coronary artery bypass surgery , and\\npercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty , al-\\nthough these are not cures. Heart disease is a chronic dis-\\nease requiring lifelong care.\\nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ,\\nusually called coronary angioplasty , is a nonsurgical pro-\\ncedure. A catheter tipped with a balloon is threaded from\\na blood vessel in the thigh into the blocked artery . The\\nballoon is inflated, compressing the plaque to enlarge the\\nblood vessel and open the blocked artery . The balloon is\\nthen deflated and the catheter removed.\\nPeople with moderate heart disease may gain ade-\\nquate control through lifestyle changes and drug therapy .\\nDrugs such as nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium-chan-\\nnel blockers relieve chest pain and complications of\\nheart disease, but they cannot clear blocked arteries. Ni-\\ntrates improve blood flow to the heart, and beta-blockers\\nreduce the amount of oxygen required by the heart dur-\\ning stress. Calcium-channel blockers help keep the arter-\\nies open and reduce blood pressure.\\nAspirin helps prevent blood clots from forming on\\nplaque deposits, reducing the likelihood of a heart attack\\nand stroke. Cholesterol-lowering medications are also in-\\ndicated in most cases.\\nCoronary angioplasty is successful about 90% of the\\ntime, but for one-third of patients the artery narrows\\nagain within six months. The procedure can be repeated.\\nIt is less invasive and less expensive than coronary artery\\nbypass surgery .\\nIn coronary artery bypass surgery , a healthy vein\\nfrom an arm, leg, or chest wall is used to build a detour\\naround the coronary artery blockage. The healthy vessel\\nthen supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Bypass\\nsurgery is major surgery . It is appropriate for those pa-\\ntients with blockages in two or three major coronary ar-\\nteries, those with severely narrowed left main coronary\\narteries, and those who have not responded to other treat-\\nments. About 70% of patients who have bypass surgery\\nexperience full relief from angina; about 20% experience\\npartial relief.

Atherectomy is a procedure in which the cardiolo-\\ngist shaves off and removes strips of plaque from the\\nblocked artery . In laser angioplasty , a catheter with a\\nlaser tip is inserted into the affected artery to burn or\\nbreak down the plaque. A metal coil called a stent can be\\nimplanted permanently to keep a blocked artery open.\\nStenting is becoming more common.\\nExpected results\\nAdvances in medicine and the adoption of healthier\\nlifestyles have caused a substantial decline in death rates\\nfrom heart disease since the mid-1980s. New diagnostic\\ntechniques enable doctors to identify and treat heart dis-\\nease in its earliest stages. New technologies and surgical\\nprocedures have extended the lives of many patients who\\nwould have otherwise died. Research on heart disease\\ncontinues.\\nPrevention\\nA healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart disease\\nand slow its progress. A heart-healthy lifestyle includes\\nmaintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, weight\\nmaintenance, no smoking, moderate drinking, control-\\nling hypertension, and managing stress. Cardiac rehabili-\\ntation programs are excellent to help prevent recurring\\ncoronary problems for people who are at risk and who\\nhave had coronary events and procedures.\\nEating right\\nA healthy diet includes a variety of foods that are\\nlow in fat, especially saturated fat, low in cholesterol,\\nand high in fiber. It includes plenty of fruits and vegeta-\\nbles and limited salt. Saturated fats should equal seven to\\n10% of calories, polyunsaturated fats should equal about\\n10%, monounsaturated fat should be 15%, and carbohy-\\ndrates should total 55-60% of daily calories. Fat should\\ncomprise no more than 30% of total daily calories and\\nshould be taken preferably as fish oil , olive oil, seeds,\\nand vegetable oil. New evidence shows that replacing\\nsaturated fat with unsaturated fat is more effective in\\nlowering coronary heart disease risk than reducing total\\nfat intake. Eating cold-water fish or taking comparable\\nomega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements can\\nhelp prevent cardiac death. In 2003, the American Heart\\nAssociation began advocating daily servings of fatty fish\\nor three fish oil capsules daily .\\nCholesterol, a waxy substance containing fats, is\\nfound in foods such as meat, dairy , eggs, and other ani-\\nmal products. It is also produced in the liver. Soluble\\nfiber can help lower cholesterol. Dietary cholesterol\\nshould be limited to about 300 milligrams per day . Many\\npopular lipid-lowering drugs can reduce LDL cholesterol\\nby an average of 25-30% when used with a low-fat, low-\\ncholesterol diet.\\nAntioxidants are chemical compounds in plant\\nfoods. When people eat antioxidant-rich foods, they may\\nimprove the function of the arteries, prevent arterial\\nplaque formation, and reduce their risk of cancer. Color-\\nful vegetables and fruits are sources of antioxidants, and\\nare rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They are low-\\ncalorie and nearly fat-free. Vitamin C and beta-carotene,\\nfound in many fruits and vegetables, keep LDL-choles-\\nterol from turning into a form that damages coronary ar-\\nteries. Whole grains, especially whole oats and oat bran,\\nreduce cholesterol.\\nExcess sodium can increase the risk of high blood\\npressure. Many processed foods contain large amounts\\nof sodium. Daily intake should be limited to about 2,400\\nmilligrams, about the amount in a teaspoon of salt.\\nThe Food Guide Pyramid developed by the U.S. De-\\npartments of Agriculture and Health and Human Ser-\\nvices provides easy-to-follow guidelines for daily heart-\\nhealthy eating.\\nExercising regularly\\nAerobic exercise can lower blood pressure, help\\ncontrol weight, and increase HDL (good) cholesterol. It\\nalso may keep the blood vessels more flexible. The Cen-\\nters for Disease Control and Prevention and the Ameri-\\ncan College of Sports Medicine recommend moderate to\\nintense aerobic exercise lasting about 30 minutes four or\\nmore times per week for maximum heart health. People\\nwith heart disease or risk factors should consult a doctor\\nbefore beginning an exercise program.\\nMaintaining a desirable body weight\\nPeople who are 20% or more over their ideal body\\nweight have an increased risk of developing heart dis-\\nease. Losing weight can help reduce total and LDL cho-\\nlesterol, reduce triglycerides, and boost HDL choles-\\nterol. It may also reduce blood pressure. Eating right and\\nexercising are two key components of losing weight.\\nQuitting smoking\\nSmoking has many adverse effects on the heart. It in-\\ncreases the heart rate, constricts major arteries, and can\\ncreate irregular heartbeats. It also raises blood pressure,\\ncontributes to the development of plaque, increases the\\nformation of blood clots, and causes blood platelets to\\ncluster and impede blood flow .

Odle\\nHeartburn\\nDefinition\\nHeartburn is a burning sensation in the chest that\\ncan extend to the neck, throat, and face. It usually oc-\\ncurs after eating and is worsened by bending, lifting, or\\nlying down.\\nDescription\\nHeartburn, sometimes called acid indigestion or\\ngastroesophageal reflux, is very common. More than one\\nthird of the population suffers from occasional heart-\\nburn, as do about one half of pregnant women. Some 50\\nmillion adult Americans complain of frequent heartburn.\\nThe occurrence of heartburn generally increases with\\nage; however, it is common—and often overlooked—in\\ninfants and children.\\nHeartburn occurs when digestive juices from the\\nstomach move back up into the esophagus, the tube con-\\nnecting the throat to the stomach. The upper third of the\\nesophagus consists of skeletal muscle that propels the\\nfood downward. The lower two-thirds of the esophagus\\nis smooth muscle. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES)\\nis a thick band of muscle that encircles the esophagus\\njust above the uppermost part of the stomach. This\\nsphincter is usually tightly closed—opening only when\\nfood passes from the esophagus into the stomach—and\\nprevents the contents of the stomach from moving back\\ninto the delicate esophageal tissue. The stomach has a\\nthick mucous coating that protects it from the strong hy-\\ndrochloric acid it secretes to digest food. However the\\nmuch-thinner esophageal mucous coating does not pro-\\ntect against stomach acid. Thus, if the LES opens inap-\\npropriately or fails to close completely , stomach acids\\ncan back up and burn the esophagus, causing heartburn.\\nOccasional heartburn is usually harmless. However,\\nfrequent or chronic heartburn (recurring more than twice\\nper week) is called gastroesophageal reflux disease\\n(GERD) and requires early management. Repeated\\nepisodes of GERD can lead to esophageal inflammation\\n(esophagitis). If the esophagus is repeatedly subjected to\\nstomach acid and digestive enzymes , ulcerations, scar-\\nring, and thickening of the esophageal walls can result.\\nThis causes a narrowing of the interior of the esophagus\\nthat can affect swallowing and the peristaltic movements\\nthat send food downward. Repeated esophageal irritation\\nalso can result in Barrett’s syndrome—changes in the\\ntypes of cells lining the esophagus. Barrett’s esophagus\\ncan develop into esophageal cancer.\\nNighttime heartburn, affecting about 80% of heart-\\nburn sufferers, is more damaging to the esophagus than\\ndaytime heartburn. It often interferes with sleep and may\\ntrigger symptoms in asthma sufferers.\\nGastroesophageal reflux may occur in children\\nunder age one, particularly pre-term babies or those with\\ncerebral palsy. It also may be a cause of some migraine\\nheadaches. In addition, chronic heartburn can be a symp-\\ntom of a gastric ulcer or coronary artery disease.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nCauses\\nHeartburn is caused by:\\n• a relaxed LES that does not close properly\\n• over-production of stomach acid\\n• increased stomach pressure\\n• a damaged esophagus with increased acid sensitivity\\nMany factors can contribute to LES malfunction:\\n• irregular eating, skipping meals\\n• smoking\\n• caffeine\\nIllustration of foaming antacid on top of the contents of a\\nhuman stomach. Heartburn is caused by a backflow of the\\nstomach’s acidic contents into the esophagus, causing in-\\nflammation and a sense of pain that can rise to the throat.\\n(Photograph by John Bavosi, Custom Medical Stock Photo.

The active\\ningredient in antacids such as Tums is calcium carbon-\\nate. Alginate (Gaviscon) is a foaming agent that coats\\nthe esophagus and the stomach to help prevent reflux.\\nOther antacids are made from aluminum hydroxide, ma-\\ngaldrate, or magnesium hydroxide.

The heavy metals most often implicated in\\nhuman poisoning are lead, mercury , arsenic, and cadmi-\\num. Some heavy metals, such as zinc, copper , chromi-\\num, iron, and manganese , are required by the body in\\nsmall amounts, but can be toxic in larger quantities.\\nHeavy metals may enter the body through food, water, or\\nair, or by absorption through the skin. Once in the body ,\\nthey compete with and displace essential minerals such\\nas zinc, copper, magnesium, and calcium, and interfere\\nwith organ system function. People may come in contact\\nwith heavy metals in industrial work, pharmaceutical\\nmanufacturing, and agriculture. Children may be poi-\\nsoned as a result of playing in contaminated soil.\\nSources of exposure for some heavy metals\\n• lead: old paint, leaded gasoline, old pipes\\n• mercury: contaminated fish, industrial and agricultural\\nwastes\\n• cadmium: industrial waste, insecticides, old galvanized\\npipes\\n• arsenic: insecticides and industrial processes, some\\ndrinking water\\nCauses & symptoms\\nSymptoms will vary , depending on the nature and\\nquantity of the heavy metal, and whether it was ingested\\nor inhaled. Patients who ingest a heavy metal may com-\\nplain of cramps, nausea, vomiting , diarrhea , stomach\\npain, headache , sweating, and a metallic taste in the\\nmouth. Mercury can cause skin burns if it has touched the\\nskin, and inhaled mercury vapor can cause severe inflam-\\nmation of the lungs. If lead is inhaled in the form of lead\\ndust, insomnia , headache, mania, and convulsions may\\noccur. In severe cases of heavy metal poisoning, patients\\nexhibit obvious impairment of cognitive, motor, and lan-\\nguage skills. The expression “mad as a hatter” comes from\\nthe mercury poisoning prevalent in seventeenth-century\\nFrance among hatmakers who soaked animal hides in a\\nsolution of mercuric nitrate to soften the hair.\\nDiagnosis\\nHeavy metal poisoning may be detected using\\nblood, urine, and stool tests, hair and tissue analysis, or x\\nrays. In children, blood lead levels above 80 mcg/dl gen-\\nerally indicate lead poisoning ; however, significantly\\nlower levels (>.30 mcg/dL) can cause mental retardation\\nand other cognitive and behavioral problems in chroni-\\ncally exposed children. The Centers for Disease Control\\nand Prevention considers a blood lead level of 10 mcg/dl\\nor higher in children a cause for concern. In adults,\\nsymptoms of lead poisoning are usually seen when blood\\nlead levels exceed 80 mcg/dl for a number of weeks.\\nBlood levels of mercury should not exceed 3.6 mcg/dl,\\nwhile urine levels should not exceed 15 mcg/dl. Symp-\\ntoms of mercury poisoning may appear when mercury\\nlevels exceed 20 mcg/dl in blood and 60 mcg/dl in urine.\\nMercury levels in hair may be used to gauge the severity\\nof chronic mercury exposure, but a 2002 report says that\\nthese tests have questionable validity .\\nSince arsenic is rapidly cleared from the blood,\\nblood arsenic levels may not be very useful in diagnosis.\\nArsenic in the urine (measured in a 24-hour collection\\nfollowing 48 hours without eating seafood) may exceed\\n50 mcg/dl in people with arsenic poisoning. If acute ar-\\nsenic poisoning is suspected, an x ray may reveal ingest-\\ned arsenic in the abdomen (since arsenic is opaque to x\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2930\\nHeavy metal poisoning\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 930'),\n",

Arsenic may also be detected in the hair and nails\\nfor months following exposure. Cadmium toxicity is\\ngenerally indicated when urine levels exceed 10 mcg/dl\\nof creatinine and blood levels exceed 5 mcg/dl.\\nT reatment\\nEmergency treatment of acute poisoning, especially\\nin children, can be handled by calling a poison control line\\n(800-222-1222) or by dialing 911. Alternative practition-\\ners often rely on the same chelating agents used by stan-\\ndard doctors to treat heavy metal poisoning, but also use\\nnatural supplements and additional techniques to assist the\\nbody’s own detoxification processes. One highly contest-\\ned issue between alternative medicine and mainstream\\ndentistry surrounds mercury poisoning. Alternative practi-\\ntioners believe that there is a large body of evidence sug-\\ngesting that silver amalgam tooth fillings, which contain\\nmercury , are a major factor in mercury poisoning. For\\nthose with high mercury levels in their bodies, they rec-\\nommend that all mercury-containing tooth fillings be re-\\nmoved by a holistic dentist. The National Institutes of\\nHealth hope to put some of the debate over amalgam fill-\\nings to rest with two clinical trials on fillings currently un-\\nderway . However, the results are not expected until 2005.\\nDietary changes are used to support the treatment of\\nheavy metal poisoning. Detoxification diets are predom-\\ninantly vegetarian, and reduce or avoid foods that may\\nstress the immune system, such as processed foods, fried\\nfoods, sugar, fat, alcohol, caffeine, meat, and dairy prod-\\nucts. Organic foods are recommended to avoid exposure\\nto pesticides and chemicals. Detoxification diets include\\nplenty of high-fiber foods, including oat bran and psylli-\\num seeds, to help cleanse the digestive tract. Apples,\\npears, and legumes are high in pectins, which are be-\\nlieved to have chelating effects on heavy metals. Foods\\nhigh in antioxidants are recommended, such as fruits,\\nvegetables, and fresh juices. Sulfur-containing foods\\nsuch as garlic , onions, and eggs (organically produced)\\nare utilized, as are dark-green leafy vegetables that con-\\ntain high amounts of chlorophyll. Foods that may con-\\ntain heavy metals are avoided, including many fish and\\nshellfish. Factory-farmed chicken and eggs are avoided\\nas well, because chickens are often fed fish meal. A 2002\\nstudy reported that eating tofu may reduce lead levels in\\nthe blood. T ofu is rich in calcium, which may help re-\\nduce the blood’s ability to absorb and retain lead.\\nNutritional supplements include antioxidant vita-\\nmins A, C, and E, and multimineral supplements that\\ncontain calcium, iron, magnesium, copper, chromium,\\nselenium, and zinc. Cysteine, methionine , L-gluthione,\\nand DMSA (dimethyl succinate) are other supplements.\\nHerbal support includes herbs that have detoxification\\neffects, such as milk thistle, burdock, and numerous oth-\\ners. Spirulina and chlorella sea algae are used as well,\\nand acidophilus helps rebuild the digestive tract.\\nHomeopathic remedies, which prompt the body’s\\ndetoxification mechanisms, have shown success with\\nheavy metal poisoning. Detoxification therapies are also\\nhighly recommended, including fasting , sweating,\\ncolonics, and therapeutic vomiting. A yurvedic medicine\\nhas an intensive detoxification and healing program\\ncalled panchakarma.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nIn an emergency , patients should call 911 or a poi-\\nson control hotline (800) 222-1222. The treatment for\\nmost heavy metal poisoning is chelation therapy . A\\nchelating agent specific to the metal involved is given\\norally , intramuscularly , or intravenously . The three most\\ncommon chelating agents are edetate calcium disodium,\\ndimercaprol (BAL), and penicillamine. Succimer\\n(DMSA) is used for children suffering from lead poison-\\ning. The chelating agent encircles and binds the metal in\\nthe body’s tissues, forming a complex that is then re-\\nleased from the tissue and travels in the bloodstream.\\nThe complex is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys\\nand excreted in the urine. This process may be lengthy\\nand painful, and typically requires hospitalization.\\nChelation therapy is effective in treating lead, mercury ,\\nand arsenic poisoning, but is not useful in treating cad-\\nmium poisoning. T o date, no treatment has been proven\\neffective for cadmium poisoning. In cases of acute mer-\\ncury or arsenic ingestion, vomiting may be induced.\\nW ashing out the stomach (gastric lavage) may also be\\nuseful. The patient may also require treatment such as\\nintravenous fluids for complications of poisoning such as\\nshock, anemia, and kidney failure.\\nExpected results\\nThe chelation process can only halt further effects of\\nthe poisoning; it cannot reverse neurological damage al-\\nready sustained.\\nPrevention\\nBecause exposure to heavy metals is often an occu-\\npational hazard, protective clothing and respirators\\nshould be provided and worn on the job. Protective\\nclothing should then be left at the work site and not worn\\nhome, where it could carry toxic dust to family mem-\\nbers. Industries are urged to reduce or replace the heavy\\nmetals in their processes wherever possible. Exposure to\\nenvironmental sources of lead, including lead-based\\npaints, plumbing fixtures, vehicle exhaust, and contami-\\nnated soil, should be reduced or eliminated.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 931\\nHeavy metal poisoning\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 931'),\n",

This condition may accompany or re-\\nsult from severe cases of inflammation to the structure\\ncalled plantar fascia. The plantar fascia is a fibrous band\\nof connective tissue on the sole of the foot, extending\\nfrom the heel to the toes.\\nDescription\\nHeel spurs are a common foot problem resulting from\\nexcess bone growth on the heel bone. The bone growth is\\nusually located on the underside of the heel bone, and may\\nextend forward toward the toes. A painful tear in the plan-\\ntar fascia between the toes and heel can produce a heel\\nspur and/or inflammation of the plantar fascia. Because\\nthis condition is often correlated to a decrease in the arch\\nof the foot, it is more prevalent after the ages of six to\\neight years, when the arch is fully developed.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nOne frequent cause of injury to the plantar fascia is\\npronation. Pronation is defined as the inward and down-\\nward action of the foot that occurs while walking, so that\\nthe foot’s arch flattens toward the ground (fallen arch). A\\ncondition known as excessive pronation creates a me-\\nchanical problem in the foot, and the portion of the plan-\\ntar fascia attached to the heel bone can stretch and pull\\naway from the bone. This damage can occur especially\\nwhile walking and during athletic activities.\\nSome symptoms at the beginning of this condition\\ninclude pain and swelling, and discomfort when pushing\\noff with the toes during walking. This movement of the\\nfoot stretches the fascia that is already irritated and in-\\nflamed. If this condition is not treated, pain will be no-\\nticed in the heel when a heel spur develops in response to\\nthe stress. This is a common condition among athletes\\nand others who run and jump a significant amount.\\nAn individual with the lower legs turning inward, a con-\\ndition called genu valgus or “knock knees, ” can have a ten-\\ndency toward excessive pronation. This can lead to a fallen\\narch and problems with the plantar fascia and heel spurs.\\nW omen tend to suffer from this condition more than men.\\nHeel spurs can also result from an abnormally high arch.\\nOther factors leading to heel spurs include a sudden\\nincrease in daily activities, an increase in weight, or a\\nthinner cushion on the bottom of the heel due to old age.\\nA significant increase in training intensity or duration\\nmay cause inflammation of the plantar fascia. High-\\nheeled shoes, improperly fitted shoes, and shoes that are\\ntoo flexible in the middle of the arch or bend before the\\ntoe joints will cause problems with the plantar fascia and\\npossibly lead to heel spurs.\\nBone spurs may cause sudden, severe pain when\\nputting weight on the affected foot.

Early intervention includes stretching the calf\\nmuscles while avoiding reinjury to the plantar fascia.\\nDecreasing or changing activities, losing excess weight,\\nand improving the fit of shoes are all important measures\\nto decrease foot pain. Modification of footwear includes\\nwell-padded shoes with a raised heel and better arch sup-\\nport. Shoe inserts recommended by a healthcare profes-\\nsional are often very helpful when used with exercises to\\nincrease the strength of the foot muscles and arch. The\\ninserts prevent excessive pronation and continued tearing\\nof the plantar fascia.\\nT o aid in the reduction of inflammation, applying ice\\nfor 10–15 minutes after activities and the use of anti-in-\\nflammatory medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen,\\ncan be helpful. Corticosteroid injections may also be used\\nto reduce pain and inflammation. Physical therapy can be\\nbeneficial with the use of heat modalities, such as ultra-\\nsound, that create a deep heat and reduce inflammation. If\\nthe pain caused by inflammation is constant, keeping the\\nfoot raised above the heart and/or compressed by wrap-\\nping with a bandage will help. T aping can help speed the\\nhealing process by protecting the fascia from reinjury , es-\\npecially during stretching and walking.\\nIn 2000, a number of U.S. podiatrists were experi-\\nmenting with a new technology known as Extracorporeal\\nPressure W ave Treatment (EPWT). This technology is\\nsimilar to lithotripsy , which uses sound waves to break\\nup kidney stones. Cost of EPWT was roughly compara-\\nble to that of surgery . Initial reports from practitioners\\nusing the treatment were positive.\\nHeel surgery\\nWhen chronic heel pain fails to respond to conserva-\\ntive treatment, surgical treatment may be necessary . Heel\\nsurgery can provide pain relief and restore mobility . The\\ntype of procedure used is based on examination and usu-\\nally consists of releasing the excessive tightness of the\\nplantar fascia, called a plantar fascia release. The proce-\\ndure may also include removal of heel spurs.\\nExpected results\\nUsually , heel spurs are curable with conservative\\ntreatment. If not, heel spurs are curable with surgery , al-\\nthough there is the possibility of them growing back.\\nAbout 10% of those who continue to see a physician for\\nplantar fascitis have it for more than a year. If there is\\nlimited success after approximately one year of conserva-\\ntive treatment, patients are often advised to have surgery .\\nPrevention\\nT o prevent this condition, wearing properly fitted\\nshoes with good arch support is very important. If a per-\\nson is overweight, weight loss can help diminish stress on\\nthe feet and help prevent foot problems. For those who\\nexercise frequently and intensely , proper stretching is al-\\nways necessary , especially when there is an increase in\\nactivities or a change in running technique. It is not rec-\\nommended to attempt to work through the pain, as this\\ncan change a mild case of heel spurs and plantar fascitis\\ninto a long-lasting and painful episode of the condition.\\nIn 2002, researchers attempted to compare the effects of\\nvarious running techniques on pronation and resulting in-\\njuries like stress fractures and heel spurs. They suggested\\nthat it is possible to teach runners to stride in such a way as\\nto minimize impact forces. One way is to lower running\\nspeed. Another is to take longer rest periods following a run.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nPerkins, Kenneth E. “Lower Extremity Orthotics in Geriatric\\nRehabilitation. ” In Geriatric Physical Therapy, edited by\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 933\\nHeel spurs\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 933'),\n",

It is designed to realign the body’s\\nstructure for overall health, improvement of posture, and\\nreduction of physical and mental stress.\\nOrigins\\nJoseph Heller (1940–) developed Hellerwork, a\\nsystem of structural integration patterned after Rolfing.\\nAlthough Heller received a degree in engineering and\\nworked for NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in\\nPasadena, CA, he became interested in humanistic psy-\\nchology in the 1970s. He spent two years studying\\nbioenergetics and Gestalt therapy as well as studying\\nunder the architect and futurist Buckminster Fuller\\n(1895–1983), the flotation tank therapy developer John\\nLilly , the family therapist V irginia Satir, and the body\\nmovement pioneer Judith Aston.\\nDuring this period, he trained for six years with Dr.\\nIda P . Rolf (1896-1979), the founder of Rolfing, and be-\\ncame a certified Rolfer in 1972. After Heller developed\\nhis own system of bodywork, he founded Hellerwork in\\n1979 and established a training facility in Mt. Shasta,\\nCalifornia, where he continues his work.\\nBenefits\\nHellerwork improves posture and brings the body’s\\nnatural structure into proper balance and alignment. This\\nrealignment can bring relief from general aches and\\npains; improve breathing; and relieve physical and men-\\ntal stress. Hellerwork has also been used to treat such\\nspecific physical problems as chronic back, neck, shoul-\\nder, and joint pain as well as repetitive stress injuries, in-\\ncluding carpal tunnel syndrome . Hellerwork is also\\nused to treat and prevent athletic injuries.\\nDescription\\nHellerwork is based largely on the principles of\\nRolfing, in which the body’s connective tissue is manip-\\nulated or massaged to realign and balance the body’s\\nstructure. Because Heller believes that physical realign-\\nment is insufficient, however, he expanded his system to\\ninclude movement education and verbal dialogue as well\\nas deep tissue massage.\\nConnective tissue massage\\nThe massage therapy aspect of Hellerwork is de-\\nsigned to release the tension that exists in the deep connec-\\ntive tissue, called fascia, and return it to a normal align-\\nment. The fascia is plastic and highly adaptable; it can\\ntighten and harden in response to the general effects of\\ngravity on the body , other ongoing physical stresses, nega-\\ntive attitudes and emotions, and periodic physical traumas.\\nOne example of ongoing physical stress is carrying a brief-\\ncase, which pulls down the shoulder on one side of the\\nbody . Over time, the connective tissue becomes hard and\\nstiff; the body becomes adapted to that position even when\\nthe person is not carrying a briefcase. In trying to adjust to\\nthe uneven weight distribution, the rest of the body be-\\ncomes unbalanced and pulled out of proper alignment.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2934\\nHellerwork\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nGenu valgus —A deformity in which the legs are\\ncurved inward so that the knees are close togeth-\\ner , nearly or actually knocking as a person walks\\nwith ankles widely apart.\\nPlantar fascia—A tough fibrous band of tissue sur-\\nrounding the muscles of the sole of the foot.\\nPlantar fascitis —Inflammation of the plantar fas-\\ncia.\\nPronation —The lowering or descending of the\\ninner edge of the foot while walking.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 934'),\n",

As stress accumulates, the body shortens and stiff-\\nens, a process commonly attributed to aging. Hellerwork\\nseeks to recondition the body and make the connective\\ntissue less rigid.\\nMovement education\\nThe second component of Hellerwork, movement\\neducation, trains patients in the proper physical move-\\nments needed to keep the body balanced and correctly\\naligned. Movement education focuses on such common\\nactions as sitting, standing, and walking. Hellerwork\\npractitioners also teach better patterns of movement for\\nactivities that are specific to each individual, such as\\ntheir job and favorite sports or social activities.\\nV erbal dialogue\\nV erbal dialogue is the third aspect of Hellerwork. It is\\ndesigned to teach awareness of the relationships among\\nemotions, life attitudes, and the body . Hellerwork practition-\\ners believe that as patients become responsible for their atti-\\ntudes, their body movements and patterns of self-expression\\nimprove. Dialogue focuses on the theme of each session and\\nthe area of the body that is worked on during that session.\\nHellerwork consists of eleven 90-minute sessions\\ncosting about $90–100 each. The first three sessions focus\\non the surface layers of the fascia and on developmental is-\\nsues of infancy and childhood. The next four sessions are\\nthe core sessions and work on the deep layers of tissue and\\non adolescent developmental issues.

(Cus-\\ntom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)\\nDescription\\nHemorrhoids are a very common medical com-\\nplaint. More than 75% of Americans have hemorrhoids\\nat some point in their lives, typically after age 30. Men\\nare more likely than women to suffer from hemorrhoids\\nthat are serious enough to require professional treatment.\\nDuring a bowel movement, veins in the anus are pro-\\ntected from damage by expanding to drain blood away\\nfrom the area. The veins are normally somewhat elastic,\\nand they snap back to their regular size after defecation is\\nfinished. However, repeated straining due to constipation\\nor hardened stools causes the veins to be swollen and\\nstretched out of shape. The swelling also triggers nerves\\nin the area, causing itchiness and a sensation of fulless in\\nthe bowel. In addition, straining may cause the rupture of\\nblood vessels and bleeding at the anus.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAging , obesity , pregnancy , chronic constipation or\\nchronic diarrhea , excessive use of enemas or laxatives,\\nstraining during bowel movements, and spending too\\nmuch time on the toilet are all factors that can contribute\\nto the development of hemorrhoids. In some people there\\nis also a genetic tendency to have fragile veins that are\\nprone to developing hemorrhoids and varicose veins.\\nThe most common symptom of internal hemorrhoids\\nis bright red blood in the toilet bowl or on one’s feces or toi-\\nlet paper. When hemorrhoids remain inside the anus they\\nare almost never painful, but they can protrude outside the\\nanus and become irritated and sore. Such hemorrhoids are\\ncalled prolapsed hemorrhoids. These sometimes move back\\ninto the anal canal on their own or can be pushed back in-\\nside; however, they may remain permanently outside the\\nanus until treated by a doctor. Small external hemorrhoids\\nusually do not produce symptoms. Larger ones, however,\\ncan be painful and interfere with sitting, walking, defecat-\\ning, and cleaning the anal area after a bowel movement.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of hemorrhoids begins with a visual ex-\\namination of the anus, followed by an internal manual\\nexamination. The doctor may also insert an anoscope, a\\nsmall tube with a light that can be used to view the anal\\ncanal. More serious problems may be ruled out using a\\nsigmoidoscope or colonoscope to inspect the colon.\\nT reatment\\nAn herbal sitz bath using witch hazel , Hamamelis\\nvirginiana, may shrink hemorrhoids and ease discom-\\nfort. A strong infusion should be prepared by adding a\\ngallon of boiling water to eight ounces of the dry herb,\\nand then letting this mixture steep overnight. The infu-\\nsion can be used several times as a 15-minute soak.\\nWitch hazel can also be wiped directly over external he-\\nmorrhoids. In addition, an ointment formulated of plan-\\ntain , Plantago spp. and yarrow , Achillea millefolium,\\nwill reportedly reduce pain and swelling.\\nChinese herbal medicine may be formulated to treat\\nSpleen Qi deficiency or heat in the lower burner. Hemp\\nseeds are recommended for constipation. Daily helpings\\nof foods that soften the stools and make them easier to\\npass are recommended by traditional Chinese medi-\\ncine (TCM); examples of these include carrots, broccoli,\\ndried persimmons and unripe figs. Acupuncture and\\nacupressure are also recommended.\\nHomeopathy offers a gentle treatment solution for\\nhemorrhoids. It is, therefore, especially appropriate for\\nuse during pregnancy . Suggested remedies include\\nAeschulus hippocastanum 30c, Hamamelis virginiana\\n6c, and Calcarea fluorica 6c. Homeopathic and herbal\\nrectal suppositories are available.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nHemorrhoids can often be dealt with effectively by\\ndietary and lifestyle changes. A voiding constipation is\\nimportant; therefore adding fiber to the diet is recom-\\nmended. Bulk laxatives and fiber supplements such as\\nMetamucil or Citrucel may be suggested. After each\\nbowel movement, wiping with a moistened tissue or pad\\nsold for that purpose helps lessen irritation. A warm sitz\\nbath for about 10 or 15 minutes two to four times a day\\ncan ease hemorrhoid pain. A cool compress or ice pack\\nto reduce swelling is also recommended. Many people\\nfind temporary relief using over-the-counter hemorrhoid\\ncreams and foams. These products, however, are not re-\\nceommended during pregnancy .\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 937'),\n",

Now it is used in vet-\\nerinary medicine, and in the manufacture of medicine,\\nluminous paint, and hair removal products.\\nAlthough Hepar sulph. has the chemical properties\\nof two other remedies, Calcium carbonica and sulfur, the\\nactions of the remedies are different.\\nGeneral use\\nHomeopaths prescribe Hepar sulph. for colds,\\ncoughs, sore throats, croup , abscesses, earaches, in-\\nflamed cuts and wounds, asthma, arthritis, emphysema,\\nherpes, constipation , conjunctivitis, Candida albicans\\ninfections, syphilis, sinusitis, and skin infections.\\nThe main indications for Hepar sulph. are as fol-\\nlows. The patient is overly sensitive to pain, touch, and\\ncold. Pains are sharp, as if a splinter or piece of glass\\nwere being poked into the skin. A sore throat may feel\\nlike a fish bone is stuck in it and the pain increases upon\\nswallowing. The slightest pressure causes much pain and\\nthe patient may faint from the pain. The patient cannot\\ntolerate the cold and any exposure to cold air causes\\nchills . If a hand or foot slips outside the bedcovers the\\npatient will become chilled. Any slight exertion will\\ncause the patient to perspire. The patient’s sweat is cold\\nand profuse and smells sour and offensive, like rotten\\ncheese. Bodily discharges are yellow and thick and also\\nsmell offensive. If a cough is present, it is a dry , hacking\\ncough with rattling of mucus in the chest.\\nThe typical Hepar sulph. patients are delicate, over-\\nsensitive persons who tend to be scrawny in build and\\nhave enlarged glands. They are slow persons with flabby\\nmuscles, and often have light hair. They catch cold easi-\\nly , dislike the cold, crave sour foods such as pickles and\\nvinegar, and may dislike fats.\\nMentally they are irritable, impulsive, angry , obsti-\\nnate, anxious, fearful, impatient, sad, and depressed.\\nThey are very hard to get along with. Nothing pleases\\nthem and they dislike company . Often the desire to com-\\nmit violence is present. They have poor memories. The\\nHepar sulph. patient is usually in a hurry—he drinks and\\neats fast and talks rapidly .\\nHepar sulph. ailments generally arise from exposure\\nto cold dry wind, suppression of perspiration and skin\\neruptions. T ypical patients suffer from a lack of internal\\nwarmth, so all symptoms are made worse from exposure\\nto cold conditions: cold air, cold weather, and cold wind.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 939\\nHepar sulphuris\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 939'),\n",

(Custom Medical\\nStock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)\\nmon forms of viral hepatitis recognized to cause liver dis-\\nease are hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C (previously\\ncalled hepatitis non-A, non-B). Other recognized types of\\nhepatitis are hepatitis D, hepatitis E, and hepatitis G.\\nDescription\\nHepatitis A\\nHepatitis A is an inflammation of the liver caused by\\nthe hepatitis A virus (HA V). It is usually not very severe,\\ngenerally starting within two to six weeks after contact\\nwith the virus, and lasting no longer than two months.\\nHepatitis A is commonly known as infectious he-\\npatitis because it spreads relatively easily from those in-\\nfected to their close contacts. Once the infection ends,\\nthere is no lasting, chronic phase of illness. However, it\\nis not uncommon to have a second episode of symptoms\\nabout a month after the first (a relapse).\\nEpidemics of HA V infection can infect dozens and\\neven hundreds of persons. Major outbreaks of hepatitis A\\nhave been linked to infected food handlers contaminat-\\ning prepared foods. Many types of food also can be in-\\nfected by sewage containing HA V , and shellfish are a\\ncommon culprit.\\nCertain groups have an increased risk of contracting\\nhepatitis A. These include:\\n• children and employees at daycare centers\\n• individuals living in crowded and/or unsanitary conditions\\n• sexually active individuals\\n• tourists visiting an area where hepatitis A is common\\nHepatitis B\\nMore than 300 million people throughout the world are\\ninfected by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Hepatitis B occurs\\nin both rapidly developing (acute) and long-lasting (chron-\\nic) forms, and is one of the most frequent chronic infectious\\ndiseases worldwide. Commonly called “serum hepatitis, ”\\nhepatitis B ranges from mild to very severe. Some people\\nwho are infected by HBV develop no symptoms, but they\\nmay carry HBV in their blood and pass the infection on to\\nothers. In its chronic form, HBV infection may destroy the\\nliver through a scarring process called cirrhosis.\\nWhen a person is infected by HBV , the virus enters\\nthe bloodstream and body fluids, and is able to pass\\nthrough tiny breaks in the skin, mouth, or the genital\\narea. This infection can occur during birth, when a moth-\\ner with hepatitis B may pass HBV on to her infant. The\\nvirus also may be transmitted through contaminated nee-\\ndles and through unprotected sex with an HBV infected\\nindividual. Casual contact cannot transmit hepatitis B.\\nHepatitis C\\nHepatitis C, or HCV , causes a rapidly developing and\\noften long-lasting disease. Spread mainly by contact with\\ninfected blood, HCV is the major cause of “transfusion\\nhepatitis, ” which can develop in patients who are given\\nblood, although, donated blood is regularly tested for he-\\npatitis C as of the early 2000s. The existence of a third he-\\npatitis virus (in addition to the A and B viruses) became\\nclear in 1974, although HCV was first identified in 1989.\\nHepatitis C is generally mild in its early , acute stage, but\\nit is much more likely to produce chronic liver disease than\\nhepatitis B. About two of every three persons who are infect-\\ned by HCV may continue to have the virus in their blood and\\nbecome carriers who can transmit the infection to others.\\nThe most common way of transmitting hepatitis C is\\nwhen blood containing the virus enters another person’s\\nbloodstream through a break in the skin or the mucosa\\n(inner lining) of the mouth or genitals. HCV may be\\npassed from an infected mother to the infant she is carry-\\ning (however, the risk of infection from breast milk is very\\nlow). It also can be spread through sexual intercourse, es-\\npecially if one partner is acutely infected at the time.\\nHepatitis D\\nHepatitis D (or delta), occurs only in patients who\\nalso are infected by the hepatitis B virus. Infection by the\\nhepatitis delta virus (HDV) either occurs at the same\\ntime as hepatitis B, or develops later when infection by\\nHBV has entered the chronic stage.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 941'),\n",

In the late 1970s\\nItalian physicians discovered that some patients with he-\\npatitis B had another type of infectious agent in their\\nliver cells. Later the new virus, HDV , was confirmed by\\nexperimentally infecting chimpanzees. When both virus-\\nes are present, acute infection tends to be more serious.\\nFurthermore, patients with both infections are more like-\\nly to develop chronic liver disease than those with HBV\\nalone, and, when it occurs, it is more severe.\\nHepatitis E\\nHepatitis E also is known as epidemic non-A, non-B\\nhepatitis. Like hepatitis A, it is an acute and short-lived\\nillness that sometimes can cause liver failure. HEV , dis-\\ncovered in 1987, is spread by the fecal-oral route. It is\\npresent in countries in which human waste has contami-\\nnated the drinking water supply . Large outbreaks (epi-\\ndemics) have occurred in Asian and South American\\ncountries where there is poor sanitation. In the United\\nStates and Canada no outbreaks have been reported, but\\npersons traveling to a region where it is present may re-\\nturn with HEV .\\nHepatitis G\\nHGV , also called hepatitis GB virus, was first de-\\nscribed in early 1996. Little is known about the frequen-\\ncy of HGV infection, the nature of the illness, or how to\\nprevent it. What is known is that transfused blood con-\\ntaining HGV has caused some cases of hepatitis. For this\\nreason, patients with hemophilia and other bleeding con-\\nditions who require large amounts of blood or blood\\nproducts are at risk of constructing hepatitis G. HGV has\\nbeen identified in 1–2% of blood donors in the United\\nStates. Also at risk are patients with kidney disease who\\nundergo hemodialysis treatments, and those who inject\\nintravenous drugs. It is possible that an infected mother\\ncan pass on the virus to her newborn infant, or that sexu-\\nal transmission can occur.\\nOften patients with hepatitis G are infected at the\\nsame time by the hepatitis B or C virus, or both. In about\\nthree of every thousand patients with acute viral hepati-\\ntis, HGV is the only virus present. There is some indica-\\ntion that patients with hepatitis G may continue to carry\\nthe virus in their blood for many years, and so might be a\\nsource of infection for others.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nHepatitis A\\nThe time between exposure to HA V and the onset of\\nsymptoms ranges from two to seven weeks and averages\\nabout one month. The virus is passed in the feces, espe-\\ncially late in the incubation period, before symptoms\\nfirst appear. The virus can live for several hours on the\\nskin surface, and during this time may be transmitted to\\nothers. Infected persons are most contagious starting\\nabout a week before symptoms develop, and remain con-\\ntagious until the time jaundice (yellowing of the skin\\nand/or eyes) is noted.\\nOften the first symptoms to appear are fatigue, mus-\\ncle and joint aches, nausea, and a loss of appetite. Low-\\ngrade fever is common, and the liver often enlarges,\\ncausing pain or tenderness in the upper right part of the\\nabdomen. Jaundice then develops, typically lasting seven\\nto ten days.\\nHepatitis B\\nIn the United States, a majority of acute HBV infec-\\ntions occur in teenagers and young adults. Half of these\\nyouth never develop symptoms, and only about 20% of\\ninfected patients develop severe symptoms and jaundice.\\nThe remaining 30% of patients have only flu-like symp-\\ntoms and will probably not even be diagnosed as having\\nhepatitis unless certain tests are done. Acute hepatitis B\\nis characterized by loss of appetite, nausea, and pain or\\ntenderness in the right upper part of the abdomen. Com-\\npared to patients with hepatitis A or C, those with HBV\\ninfection require more bed rest.\\nAn HBV infection lasting longer than six months is\\nsaid to be chronic. After this time it is much less likely\\nfor the infection to disappear. Not all carriers of the virus\\ndevelop chronic liver disease; in fact, most have no\\nsymptoms. However, about one in every four HBV carri-\\ners develop cirrhosis. Patients are also likely to have an\\nenlarged liver and spleen. The most serious complication\\nof chronic HBV infection is liver cancer.\\nHepatitis C\\nMore than half of all patients who develop hepatitis C\\nhave no symptoms or signs of liver disease. Some, howev-\\ner, may have a minor illness with flu-like symptoms.\\nAbout one in four patients with hepatitis C will develop\\njaundice, and some patients lose their appetite and fre-\\nquently feel tired. Patients also may experience nausea.\\nIn most patients, HCV can still be found in the blood\\nsix months after the start of acute infection, and these pa-\\ntients are considered carriers. If the virus persists for one\\nyear, it is unlikely to disappear completely . About 20% of\\nchronic carriers develop cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver\\nwhen the virus damages or destroys large numbers of\\nliver cells, which are then replaced by scar tissue.

Perhaps this small size is why it cannot cause infec-\\ntion on its own. Its companion virus, HBV , actually\\nforms a covering over the HDV particle. In chronically\\nill patients (those whose virus persists longer than six\\nmonths), cirrhosis typically occurs.\\nWhen HBV and HDV infections develop at the\\nsame time—a condition called coinfection—recovery is\\nthe rule. Only 2–5% of patients become chronic carriers\\n(the virus remains in their blood more than six months\\nafter infection). It may be that HDV actually keeps HBV\\nfrom reproducing as rapidly as it would if it were alone,\\nmaking chronic infection less likely .\\nWhen HBV infection occurs first and is followed by\\nHDV infection, the condition is called superinfection. Be-\\ntween one-half and two-thirds of patients with superin-\\nfection develop severe acute hepatitis. Once the liver cells\\ncontain large numbers of HBV viruses, HDV tends to re-\\nproduce more actively . Massive infection and liver failure\\nare more common in superinfection. The risk of liver can-\\ncer, however, is no greater than from hepatitis B alone.\\nAs with other forms of hepatitis, the earliest symp-\\ntoms are nausea, loss of appetite, joint pains, and fatigue.\\nThere may be fever and an enlarged liver may cause dis-\\ncomfort or pain in the right upper part of the abdomen.\\nJaundice may develop later.\\nHepatitis E\\nThere are at least two strains of HEV , one found in\\nAsia and another in Mexico. The virus may start dividing\\nin the gastrointestinal tract, but it grows mostly in the\\nliver. After an incubation period of two to eight weeks,\\ninfected persons develop jaundice, fever, nausea, a loss\\nof appetite, and discomfort or pain in the right upper part\\nof the abdomen. Most often the illness is mild and disap-\\npears within a few weeks with no lasting effects.\\nHepatitis E never becomes a chronic illness, but on\\nrare occasions the acute illness damages and destroys so\\nmany liver cells that the liver can no longer function.\\nThis is called fulminant liver failure, and may end in\\ndeath. The great majority of patients who recover from\\nacute infection do not continue to carry HEV and cannot\\npass the infection on to others.\\nHepatitis G\\nSome researchers believe that there may be a group of\\nGB viruses, rather than just one. Others remain doubtful\\nthat HGV actually causes illness. If it does, the type of\\nacute or chronic illness that results is not clear. When diag-\\nnosed, acute HGV infection has usually been mild and\\nbrief. There is no evidence of serious complications, but it\\nis possible that, like other hepatitis viruses, HGV can cause\\nsevere liver damage resulting in liver failure. The virus has\\nbeen identified in as many as 20% of patients with long-\\nlasting viral hepatitis, some of whom also have hepatitis C.\\nDiagnosis\\nA health care professional will conduct a thorough\\nmedical history and physical examination of the patient\\nwhen hepatitis is suspected. Blood tests for specific anti-\\ngens and antibodies that are present in the different sub-\\ntypes of hepatitis will confirm the diagnosis, although these\\ntests cannot detect all types of hepatitis. Liver function tests\\nthat measure enzyme levels may also be performed.\\nT reatment\\nOnce symptoms appear, no antibiotics or other med-\\nicines will shorten the course of infectious hepatitis. Pa-\\ntients should rest in bed as needed, follow a healthy diet,\\nand avoid drinking alcohol or taking any medications\\nthat could further damage the liver. Any medication that\\ncan cause liver damage should be avoided, and non-criti-\\ncal surgery should be postponed.\\nAn herbalist or naturopathic health care professional\\nmay recommend a preparation of milk thistle (Silybum\\nmarianum ) for the treatment of hepatitis. Milk thistle is\\nthought to promote the growth of new liver cells, and to\\nprevent toxins from penetrating through healthy liver\\ncells by binding itself to the cell membranes. It is fre-\\nquently prescribed by herbalists for the treatment of cir-\\nrhosis, hepatitis, and other liver disorders. A large con-\\ntrolled trial sponsored by the National Center for Com-\\nplementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and the\\nNational Institutes of health (NIH) on milk thistle’s med-\\nicinal value in the treatment of hepatitis and liver injury\\nwas scheduled to begin in the year 2000. Licorice (Gly-\\ncyrriza glabra ) may also be used for hepatitis. Its prop-\\nerties include protecting the liver and enhancing the im-\\nmune system. Extended use of licorice should not be un-\\ndertaken without medical consultation, since potassium\\ndeficiency may result.\\nVitamin C may be taken as a nutritional supple-\\nment. It has been shown to help diminish acute hepatitis\\nand help prevent hepatitis in hospitalized patients. Liver\\nextracts are effective in liver regeneration, and have been\\nused for over a century .

Other patients face two risks: they themselves\\nmay develop chronic liver infection and possibly serious\\ncomplications such as liver cancer, and they will continue\\ncarrying the virus and may pass it on to others. The overall\\nrisk of developing cirrhosis is about 15% for all patients\\ninfected by HCV . Liver failure is less frequent in patients\\nwith chronic hepatitis C than it is for those with other\\nforms of hepatitis. In those people who also have AIDS,\\nhepatitis C infection increases the chance for liver cancer.\\nHepatitis D\\nA large majority of patients with coinfection of\\nHBV and HDV recover from an episode of acute hepati-\\ntis. However, about two-thirds of patients chronically in-\\nfected by HDV go on to develop cirrhosis of the liver. If\\nsevere liver failure develops, the chance of a patient sur-\\nviving is no better than 50%.

The use of condoms during sex also\\nis advisable. Travelers should avoid water and ice if un-\\nsure of their purity , or they can boil water before drink-\\ning it. All foods eaten should be packaged, well cooked,\\nor, in the case of fresh fruit, peeled. Caution should be\\nexercised when getting tattoos or body piercing, since a\\n2003 report said that only about one-half of tattoo and\\npiercing shops follow the government’s guidelines con-\\ncerning infection control.

Since that time,\\nherbal practices have been more extensively documented\\nand refined. In modern China, traditional Chinese herbal-\\nism is taught alongside conventional W estern pharmacol-\\nogy . Chinese herbal remedies have been used in the W est\\nonly relatively recently , over the past two decades. These\\nremedies are more gentle and natural than conventional\\nmedicines. In addition, they have fewer unpleasant side\\neffects. Individuals with chronic disorders in particular\\nare increasingly drawn to the holistic aspect of Chinese\\nherbalism and TCM in general.\\nOrigins\\nHistorical background\\nTraditional Chinese medicine originated in the region\\nof eastern Asia that today includes China, Tibet, V ietnam,\\nKorea, and Japan. Tribal shamans and holy men who lived\\nas hermits in the mountains of China as early as 3500 \\nB.C.\\npracticed what was called the “W ay of Long Life. ” This\\nregimen included a diet based on herbs and other plants;\\nkung-fu exercises; and special breathing techniques that\\nwere thought to improve vitality and life expectancy .\\nAfter the Han dynasty , the next great age of Chinese\\nmedicine was under the T ang emperors, who ruled from\\nA.D. 608–906. The first T ang emperor established\\nChina’s first medical school in A.D. 629. Under the Song\\n(A.D.) 960–1279 and Ming ( A.D. 1368–1644) dynasties,\\nnew medical schools were established, their curricula\\nand qualifying examinations were standardized, and the\\ntraditional herbal prescriptions were written down and\\ncollected into encyclopedias.

The interplay between\\nyin, yang, and qi gave rise to the Five Elements of water,\\nmetal, earth, wood, and fire. These entities are all reflect-\\ned in the structure and functioning of the human body .\\nThe human being\\nTraditional Chinese physicians did not learn about\\nthe structures of the human body from dissection be-\\ncause they thought that cutting open a body insulted the\\nperson’s ancestors. Instead they built up an understand-\\ning of the location and functions of the major organs\\nover centuries of observation, and then correlated them\\nwith the principles of yin, yang, qi, and the Five Ele-\\nments. Thus wood is related to the liver (yin) and the gall\\nbladder (yang); fire to the heart (yin) and the small intes-\\ntine (yang); earth to the spleen (yin) and the stomach\\n(yang); metal to the lungs (yin) and the large intestine\\n(yang); and water to the kidneys (yin) and the bladder\\n(yang). The Chinese also believed that the body contains\\nFive Essential Substances, which include blood, spirit,\\nvital essence (a principle of growth and development\\nproduced by the body from qi and blood), fluids (all\\nbody fluids other than blood, such as saliva, spinal fluid,\\nsweat, etc.), and qi.\\nBenefits\\nBecause it is a safe and inexpensive solution to\\nhealth problems of all kinds, Chinese herbalism is very\\npopular in China. In recent years, herbalism has been\\nmodernized with the introduction of quality control. For\\nexample, herbs are subjected to absorption spectrometry\\nto determine levels of heavy metals found in some. Be-\\ncause they are standardized, Chinese herbs are safer for\\nself-treatment. This approach puts the individual, not the\\nphysician, in charge of the individual’s health; that is a\\nbasic goal of Chinese herbalism.\\nChinese herbalism offers unique advice regarding\\nwhat foods can help and what can hinder, and a herbalist\\ncan help an individual discover what he is allergic to. In\\naddition, Chinese herbs stimulate the immune system\\nand provide beneficial nutrients, aside from their role in\\ncuring illness.\\nAt M.D. Anderson Hospital in T exas, medical re-\\nsearch has confirmed that patients undergoing\\nchemotherapy were shown to have an improved degree\\nof immune function when they took the tonic herb astra-\\ngalus ( huang qi ).

In Chinese practice, sev-\\neral different herbs may be used, according to each\\nplant’s effect on the individual’s Qi and the Five Ele-\\nments. There are many formulas used within traditional\\nChinese medicine to treat certain common imbalance\\npatterns. These formulas can be modified to fit specific\\nindividuals more closely .\\nA traditional Chinese herbal formula typically con-\\ntains four classes of ingredients, arranged in a hierarchi-\\ncal order: a chief (the principal ingredient, chosen for the\\npatient’s specific illness); a deputy (to reinforce the\\nchief’s action or treat a coexisting condition); an assis-\\ntant (to counteract side effects of the first two ingredi-\\nents); and an envoy (to harmonize all the other ingredi-\\nents and convey them to the parts of the body that they\\nare to treat).\\nMethods of diagnosis\\nA Chinese herbalist will not prescribe a particular\\nherb on the strength of symptoms only , but will take into\\nconsideration the physical condition, emotional health,\\nand mental state of the patient. He or she may look at the\\ncondition of the patient’s hair, skin, and tongue, as well\\nas the appearance of the eyes, lips, and general complex-\\nion. The practitioner then listens to the sounds the body\\nmakes when breathing. He or she may smell the breath,\\nbody odor, or sputum in diagnosis.\\nTCM practitioners take an extensive medical history\\nof a patient. He or she may ask about dietary habits,\\nlifestyle, and sleep patterns. The patient will be ques-\\ntioned about chief medical complaints, as well as on his\\nor her particular emotional state and sexual practices.\\nChinese herbalists employ touch as a diagnostic\\ntool. They may palpate the body or use light massage to\\nassess the patient’s physical health. Another chief com-\\nponent of Chinese medical diagnosis is pulse diagnosis,\\nor sphygmology . This is a very refined art that takes\\npractitioners years to master. Some practitioners can de-\\ntect 12 different pulse points that correspond to the 12\\nmajor organs in Chinese medicine. There are over 30\\npulse qualities that practitioners are able to detect on\\neach point. The strength, speed, quality , and rhythm of\\nthe pulse, to name a few , will be determined before a di-\\nagnosis is given.\\nHerbs\\nChinese herbs may be used alone or in combination.\\nRelatively few are used alone for medicinal purposes.\\nPractitioners believe that illness can be effectively treated\\nby combining herbs based on their various characteristics\\nand the patient’s overall health. Every herb has four basic\\nhealing properties: nature, taste, affinity , and effect.\\nAn herb’s nature is described according to its yin or\\nyang characteristics. Y ang, or warming, herbs treat cold\\ndeficiencies. They are frequently used in the treatment of\\nthe upper respiratory tract, skin, or extremities. Yin, or\\ncooling, herbs, treat conditions of excessive heat. They\\nare most often used to treat internal conditions and prob-\\nlems with organs. Herbs can also be neutral in nature.\\nAn herb’s taste does not refer to its flavor, but to its\\neffect on qi, blood, fluids, and phlegm. Sour herbs have a\\nconcentrating action. They are prescribed to treat bodily\\nexcess conditions, such as diarrhea, and concentrate qi.\\nBitter herbs have an eliminating or moving downward\\naction. They are used to treat coughs, constipation , and\\nheart problems. Sweet or bland herbs have a harmoniz-\\ning action. They are used as restorative herbs and to treat\\npain . Spicy herbs have a stimulating action. They are\\nprescribed to improve blood and qi circulation. Salty\\nherbs have a softening action. They are used to treat con-\\nstipation and other digestion problems.\\nAn herb’s affinity describes its action on a specific\\nbodily organ. (Note that Chinese medicine does not have\\nthe anatomical correlation for organ names. They corre-\\nspond more closely to the organ’s function.) Sour herbs\\nhave an affinity for the Liver and Gallbladder. Bitter\\nherbs act on the Heart and Small Intestine. Sweet and\\nbland herbs affect the Stomach and Spleen. Spicy herbs\\nhave an affinity for the Lungs and Large Intestine,\\nwhereas salty herbs act on the Kidneys and Bladder.\\nChinese herbs are lastly classified according to their\\nspecific actions, which are divided into four effects. Herbs\\nthat dispel are used to treat an accumulation, sluggishness,\\nor spasm by relaxing or redistributing. Herbs with an as-\\ntringent action are used to consolidate or restrain a condi-\\ntion characterized by discharge or excessive elimination.\\nHerbs that purge treat an obstruction or “poison” by en-\\ncouraging elimination and detoxification.

In addition, cases have been reported in Europe as\\nwell as the United States of dried Chinese herbs contam-\\ninated by sewage or other forms of pollution.\\nWhen treating a patient, the herbalist will aim to\\ngently “nudge” the system into shape, rather than pro-\\nducing any immediate reaction. A return to health, there-\\nfore, may take time, and it is important that the patient\\nrealize the principles underlying the treatment. Some\\npractitioners estimate that treatment will take a month\\nfor every year that a chronic condition has existed. The\\nadvantage of the slow pace is that if there is a bad reac-\\ntion to any herb, which is rare, it will be mild because\\nthe treatment itself is gentle.\\nAs with most naturopathic therapies, Chinese herbal\\nremedies work best when taken in conjunction with a\\nhealthy lifestyle and program of exercise.\\nSide effects\\nSome Chinese herbs are incompatible with certain\\nprescription drugs or foods. Others should not be taken\\nduring pregnancy. Because of possible interactions, per-\\nsons who are interested in taking traditional Chinese\\nherbal remedies should not try to diagnose or treat them-\\nselves with these preparations.\\nRecent studies indicate that some herbs used in Chi-\\nnese medicines may cause liver damage.

W estern herbalism is based on physicians’\\nand herbalists’ clinical experience and traditional knowl-\\nedge of medicinal plant remedies preserved by oral tradi-\\ntion and in written records over thousands of years.\\nW estern herbalism, like the much older system of tradi-\\ntional Chinese medicine , relies on the synergistic and\\ncurative properties of the plant to treat symptoms and\\ndisease and maintain health.\\nW estern herbalism is based upon pharmocognosy ,\\nthe study of natural products. Pharmocognosy includes\\nthe identification, extraction methods, and applications\\nof specific plant constituents responsible for specific\\ntherapeutic actions, such as the use of digoxin from digi-\\ntalis leaf for heart failure. These constituents are extract-\\ned, purified and studied in clinical research. They may be\\nconcentrated to deliver standardized, set doses. Some-\\ntimes, the natural constituent can be synthesized in the\\nlaboratory , or changed and patented. Practitioners may\\nchoose to use fresh medicinal plants, simple extracts, or\\nstandardized extracts.\\nIn standardized extracts, a specific quantity of a con-\\nstituent is called a marker compound, and it may or may\\nnot be the active constituent(s) in the plant medicine. The\\nproducts should be produced under good manufacturing\\nprocesses and according to the traditional National F ormu-\\nlary, the U. S. Dispensatory,or the U. S. Pharmacopeia.\\nOrigins\\nOver 2,500 years ago Hippocrates wrote, “In medi-\\ncine one must pay attention not to plausible theorizing\\nChinese medicine within the W estern framework of pre-\\ncise physical measurements and scientific hypotheses.\\nT raining & certification\\nPractitioners of Oriental medicine can obtain certifi-\\ncation in Chinese herbalism through the National Com-\\nmission for the Certification of Acupuncture and Oriental\\nMedicine, (NCCAOM). Some states have adopted the\\nNCCAOM examination as all or part of their criteria for\\nlicensing. In California, the standards are higher, and these\\nqualifications are not accepted.

This complex approach to\\nherbal medicine was a dramatic change from the simple\\nremedies recommended by Hippocrates and employed\\nby traditional folk healers. Galen developed a rigid sys-\\ntem of medicine in which the physician, with his special-\\nized knowledge of complex medical formulas, was con-\\nsidered the ultimate authority in matters of health care.\\nThe Galenic system, relying on theory and scholarship\\nrather than observation, persisted throughout the Middle\\nAges. The galenical compounds, along with bloodlet-\\nting, and purging, were among the drastic techniques\\npracticed by the medical professionals during those\\ntimes; however, traditional herbal healers persisted out-\\nside the mainstream medical system.\\nDuring the eighth century a medical school was es-\\ntablished in Salerno, Italy , where the herbal knowledge\\naccumulated by Arab physicians was preserved. The\\nArabian Muslims conducted extensive research on medi-\\ncinal herbs found in Europe, Persia, India, and the Far\\nEast. Arab businessmen opened the first herbal pharma-\\ncies early in the ninth century . The Leech Book of Bald ,\\nthe work of a Christian monk, was compiled in the tenth\\ncentury . It preserved important medical writings that had\\nsurvived from the work of physicians in ancient Greece\\nand Rome.\\nThe Middle Ages in Europe were a time of wide-\\nspread death by plagues and pestilence. The Black\\nPlague of 1348, particularly , and other health catastro-\\nphes in later years, claimed so many lives that survivors\\nbegan to lose faith in the dominant Galenic medical sys-\\ntem. Fortunately , the knowledge of traditional herbal\\nmedicine had not been lost. Medieval monks who culti-\\nvated extensive medicinal gardens on the monastery\\ngrounds also patiently copied the ancient herbal and\\nmedical texts. Folk medicine as practiced in Europe by\\ntraditional healers persisted, even though many women\\nherbalists were persecuted as witches and enemies of the\\nCatholic Church and their herbal arts were suppressed.\\nThe growing spice trade and explorations to the New\\nW orld introduced exotic plants, and a whole new realm of\\nbotanical medicines became available to Europeans. Fol-\\nlowing the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth\\ncentury , a large number of herbal texts, also simply called\\nherbals, became available for popular use. Among them\\nwere the beautifully illustrated works of the German\\nbotanists Otto Brunfels and Leonhard Fuchs published in\\n1530, and the Dutch herbal of Belgian physician Rembert\\nDodoens, a popular work that was later reproduced in\\nEnglish. In 1597, the physician and gardener John Gerard\\npublished one of the most famous of the English herbals,\\nstill in print today .

He stressed\\nthe importance of diet, water quality , climate, and social\\nenvironment in the development of disease. Hippocrates\\nbelieved in treating the whole person rather than merely\\nisolating and treating symptoms. He recognized the in-\\nnate capacity of the body to heal itself, and emphasized\\nthe importance of keen observation in the medical prac-\\ntice. He recommended simple herbal remedies to assist\\nthe body in restoring health.\\nAncient Greek medicine around the fifth century\\nB.C. was a fertile ground for contrasting philosophies and\\nreligions. Greek physicians were influenced by the accu-\\nmulated medical knowledge from Egypt, Persia, and\\nBabylon. Medical advances flourished and practitioners\\nand scholars were free to study and practice without reli-\\ngious and secular constraints. In the fourth century \\nB.C.,\\nTheophrastus wrote the Historia Plantarum , considered\\nto be the founding text in the science of botany .\\nDuring the first century A.D. Dioscorides, a Greek\\nphysician who traveled with the Roman legions, pro-\\nduced five medical texts. His herbal text, known as the\\nDe Materia Medica, is considered to be among the most\\ninfluential of all western herbal texts. It became a stan-\\ndard reference for practitioners for the next 1,500 years.\\nThis influential book also included information on medi-\\ncinal herbs and treatments that had been used for cen-\\nturies in Indian A yurvedic medicine.

Gerard did, however,\\ninclude descriptions of some of the more than one thou-\\nsand species of rare and exotic plants and English flora\\nfrom his own garden.\\nThe correspondence of astrology with herbs was\\ntaught by Arab physicians who regarded astrology as a\\nscience helpful in the selection of medicines and in the\\ntreatment of diseases. This approach to W estern herbal-\\nism was particularly evident in the herbal texts published\\nin the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. One of the\\nmost popular and controversial English herbals is The\\nEnglish Physician Enlarged published in 1653. The au-\\nthor, Nicholas Culpeper, was an apothecary by trade. He\\nalso published a translation of the Latin language London\\nPharmacopoeia into English. Culpeper was a noncon-\\nformist in loyalist England, and was determined to make\\nmedical knowledge more accessible to the apothecaries,\\nthe tradesmen who prescribed most of the herbal reme-\\ndies. Culpeper’s herbal was criticized by the medical es-\\ntablishment for its mix of magic and astrology with\\nbotanical medicine, but it became one of the most popu-\\nlar compendia of botanical medicine of its day . Culpeper\\nalso accepted the so-called “Doctrine of Signatures, ”\\npracticed by medieval monks in their medicinal gardens.\\nThis theory teaches that the appearance of plants is the\\nclue to their curative powers. Plants were chosen for\\ntreatment of particular medical conditions based on their\\nassociations with the four natural elements and with a\\nplanet or sign. The place where the plant grows, its domi-\\nnant physical feature, and the smell and taste of an herb\\ndetermined the plant’s signature. Culpeper’s herbal is still\\nin print in facsimile copies, and some pharmocognosists\\nand herbalists in the twenty-first century voice the same\\ncriticisms that Culpeper’s early critics did.\\nEuropean colonists brought their herbal knowledge\\nand plant specimens to settlements in North America,\\nwhere they learned from the indigenous Americans how\\nto make use of numerous nutritive and medicinal plants\\nnative to the New W orld. Many European medicinal\\nplants escaped cultivation from the early settlements and\\nhave become naturalized throughout North America. The\\nfirst record of Native American herbalism is found in the\\nmanuscript of the native Mexican Indian physician, Juan\\nBadianus, published in 1552. The American folk tradition\\nof herbalism developed as a blend of traditional European\\nmedicine and Native American herbalism. The pioneer\\nnecessity for self-reliance contributed to the perseverance\\nof folk medicine well into the twentieth century .\\nIn Europe in the seventeenth century , the alchemist\\nParacelsus changed the direction of W estern medicine\\nwith the introduction of chemical and mineral medicines.\\nHe was the son of a Swiss chemist and physician.\\nParacelsus began to apply chemicals, such as arsenic,\\nmercury , sulfur , iron, and copper sulfate to treat dis-\\nease. His chemical approach to the treatment of disease\\nwas a forerunner to the reliance in the twentieth century\\non chemical medicine as the orthodox regimen treatment\\nprescribed in mainstream medical practice.\\nThe nineteenth and twentieth centuries brought a re-\\nnewed interest in the practice of western herbalism and\\nthe development of natural therapies and health care sys-\\ntems that ran counter to the mainstream methods of com-\\nbating disease symptoms with synthetic pharmaceuticals.\\nIn the late eighteenth century , the German physician\\nSamuel Hahnemann developed a system of medicine\\nknown as homeopathy . This approach to healing em-\\nbraces the philosophy of “like cures like. ” Homeopathy\\nuses extremely diluted solutions of herbs, animal prod-\\nucts, and chemicals that are believed to hold a “trace\\nmemory” or energetic imprint of the substance used.\\nHomeopathic remedies are used to amplify the patient’s\\nsymptoms with remedies that would act to produce the\\nsame symptom in a healthy person. Homeopathy holds\\nthat the symptoms of illness are evidence of the body’s\\nnatural process of healing and eliminating the cause of\\nthe disease.\\nIn 1895, the European medical system known as\\nnaturopathy was introduced to North America. Like\\nhomeopathy , this medical approach is based on the Hip-\\npocratic idea of eliminating disease by assisting the\\nbody’s natural healing abilities. The naturopath uses\\nnontoxic methods to assist the body’s natural healing\\nprocesses, including nutritional supplements, herbal\\nremedies, proper diet, and exercise to restore health.\\nW estern herbalism is regaining popularity at a time\\nwhen the world faces the stress of overpopulation and de-\\nvelopment that threatens the natural biodiversity neces-\\nsary for these valuable medicinal plants to survive. The\\nAmerican herb market is growing rapidly and increasing\\nnumbers of individuals are choosing alternative therapies\\nover mainstream allopathic W estern medicine. It is pro-\\njected that by the year 2002 consumers will spend more\\nthan seven billion dollars a year on herbal products.\\nThough research into the efficacy and safety of tra-\\nditional herbal remedies is increasing, it has been limited\\nby the high costs of clinical studies and laboratory re-\\nsearch, and by the fact that whole plants and their con-\\nstituents are not generally patentable (therefore, there is\\nno drug profit after market introduction).

The\\nW orld Health Organization promotes traditional herbal\\nmedicine for treatment of many local health problems,\\nparticularly in the Third W orld, where it is affordable\\nand already well integrated into the cultural fabric.\\nIn the United States, the re-emergence in interest in\\nholistic approaches to health care is evident. Citizens are\\ndemanding access to effective, safe, low-cost, natural\\nmedicine.

If the current\\ntrend continues, U. S. citizens will benefit from a choice\\namong a variety of safe and effective medical treatments.\\nBenefits\\nThe benefits of botanical medicine may be subtle or\\ndramatic, depending on the remedy used and the symp-\\ntom or problem being addressed. Herbal remedies usually\\nhave a much slower effect than pharmaceutical drugs.\\nSome herbal remedies have a cumulative effect and work\\nslowly over time to restore balance, and others are indi-\\ncated for short-term treatment of acute symptoms. When\\ncompared to pharmaceutical drugs, herbal remedies pre-\\npared from the whole plant have relatively few side ef-\\nfects. This characteristic is due to the complex chemistry\\nand synergistic action of the full range of phytochemicals\\npresent in the whole plant, and the relatively lower con-\\ncentrations. They are generally safe when used in proper-\\nly designated therapeutic dosages, and less costly than the\\nisolated chemicals or synthetic prescription drugs avail-\\nable from western pharmaceutical corporations.\\nDescription\\nHerbs are generally defined as any plant or plant part\\nthat may be used for medicinal, nutritional, culinary , or\\nother beneficial purposes. The active constituents of\\nplants (if known) may be found in varying amounts in the\\nroot, stem, leaf, flower, and fruit, etc. of the plant. Herbs\\nmay be classified into many different categories. Some\\nW estern herbalists categorize herbal remedies according\\nto their strength, action, and characteristics. Categories\\nmay include sedatives, stimulants, laxatives, febrifuges\\n(to reduce fever), and many others. One system of classi-\\nfication is based on a principle in traditional Chinese\\nmedicine that categorizes herbs into four classes: tonics,\\nspecifics, heroics, or cleansers and protectors. Within\\nthese broad classifications are the numerous medicinal\\nactions of the whole herb, which may be due to a specific\\nchemical or combination of chemicals in the plant.\\n• T onics. Herbs in this classification are also known as\\nalteratives in western herbalism. They are generally\\nmild in their action and act slowly in the body , provid-\\ning gentle stimulation and nutrition to specific organs\\nand systems. T onic herbs act over time to strengthen\\nand nourish the whole body . These herbs are generally\\nsafe and may be used regularly , even in large quantities.\\nThese tonic herbs are known as “superior” remedies in\\ntraditional Chinese medicine. The therapeutic dose of\\ntonic remedies is far removed from the possible toxic\\ndose. American ginseng is an example of a tonic herb.\\n• Specifics. Herbs in this classification are strong and\\nspecific in their therapeutic action. They are generally\\nused for short periods of time in smaller dosages to\\ntreat acute conditions. Herbs classified as specifics are\\nnot used beyond the therapeutic treatment period.\\nEchinacea is a specific herb.\\n• Heroic. These herbs offer high potency but are poten-\\ntially toxic, and should not be used in self-treatment.\\nBecause the therapeutic dosage may be close to the\\nlethal dosage, these herbs are presented cautiously and\\nclosely monitored or avoided by trained clinicians.\\nThey should not be used continuously or without expert\\nsupervision. Poke ( Phytolacca americana ) is an exam-\\nple of a heroic remedy .\\n• Cleansers and protectors. These herbs, plants, and plant\\ntissues remove wastes and pollutants, while minimally\\naffecting regular body processes. An example of a\\ncleanser is pectin. Pectins are the water-soluble sub-\\nstances that bind cell walls in plant tissues, and some\\nresearchers believe that they help remove heavy metals\\nand environmental toxins from the body .\\nPreparations\\nHerbal preparations are commercially available in a\\nvariety of forms, including tablets or capsules, tinctures,\\nteas, fluid extracts, douches, washes, suppositories, dried\\nherbs, and many other forms. The medicinal properties\\nof herbs are extracted from the fresh or dried plant parts\\nby the use of solvents appropriate to the particular herb.\\nAlcohol, oil, water, vinegar, glycerin, and propylene gly-\\ncol are some of the solvents used to extract and concen-\\ntrate the medicinal properties. Steam distillation and\\ncold-pressing techniques are used to extract the essential\\noils. The quality of any herbal remedy and the potency of\\nthe phytochemicals found in the herb depend greatly on\\nthe conditions of weather and soil where the herb was\\ngrown, the timing and care in harvesting, and the manner\\nof preparation and storage.\\nPrecautions\\nHerbal remedies prepared by infusion, decoction, or\\nalcohol tincture from the appropriate plant part, such as\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2952\\nHerbalism, Western\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 952'),\n",

The Internet has a num-\\nber of sites available with unregulated and often un-\\nhealthy advice about use of herbal remedies. Many\\nherbalists and allopathic physicians urge patients to use\\ncaution when seeking Internet information on herbal\\ntreatments. One cancer-related study found that only\\n36% of the web sites found in a search offered informa-\\ntion that complied with regulatory guidelines about un-\\nsubstantiated claims about treatment or cure of disease.\\nSide effects\\nHerbs contain a variety of complex phytochemicals\\nthat act on the body as a whole or on specific organs and\\nsystems. Some of these chemical constituents are mild\\nand safe, even in large doses. Other herbs contain chemi-\\ncals that act more strongly and may be toxic in large\\ndoses or when taken continuously . Drug interactions are\\npossible with certain herbs when combined with certain\\npharmaceutical drugs. Some herbs are tonic in a small\\namount and toxic in larger dosages.\\nIn 2002, a report to the American Academy of Pedi-\\natrics cautioned members to watch for signs of adverse\\neffects to the cardiovascular system of children from cer-\\ntain herbal remedies that are often not revealed by their\\nfamilies. For example, ephedra causes increases in heart\\nrate and blood pressure. Other examples of child and\\nadolescent patients with heart complications from herbs\\ngiven to them that their parents assumed would be harm-\\nless were given by the presenter. Another report said that\\neven adult patients fail to inform their physicians about\\nherbal products they are using, and that patients do not\\nthink of them as medicines. Y et many herbal products\\ncan interact with allopathic medicines and either cancel\\ntheir effects or cause adverse effects. For example, gar-\\nlic, ginseng, ginkgo, feverfew, licorice , and other com-\\nmon remedies have anticoagulant properties that can put\\npatients as risk of bleeding during surgery .\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nW estern herbalism is experiencing a revival of popu-\\nlar and professional interest. The number of training\\nschools and qualified herbal practitioners is growing to\\nmeet the demand. W estern herbalism is incorporated into\\nthe medical practice of licensed naturopathic doctors,\\nwho receive special training in clinical herbalism. Folk\\nherbalists, heir to the continuing oral traditions passed\\nfrom generation to generation in many rural areas, as\\nwell as amateur self-taught herbalists, keep the practice\\nof botanical medicine alive at the grassroots level. Tradi-\\ntional W estern herbalism relies on traditional use and\\nmateria medica, folk wisdom, and recent clinical re-\\nsearch and advances in the extraction processes. These\\nadvances provide increased quality control on the con-\\ncentration and potency of the active ingredients. W estern\\nphysicians, educated in allopathic medicine, typically re-\\nceive no training in the use of herbs. These doctors rely\\non pharmaceutical drugs for their patients, and some cite\\nthe following reasons for continuing to do so: lack of\\nstandardized dosages, lack of quality control in the\\npreparation of herbal medicinals, and the dearth of clini-\\ncal research verifying the safety and effectiveness of\\nmany traditional herbal remedies.\\nHerbalism is widely practiced throughout Europe,\\nparticularly in England, France, Italy , and Germany ,\\nwhere phytomedicinals are available in prescription form\\nand as over-the-counter remedies.

W estern\\nclinical herbalism is taught through a growing number of\\ninstitutions and organizations offering training and certifi-\\ncation through residential and apprenticeship programs,\\nand by correspondence. Some programs are comprehen-\\nsive, with curricula in physiology , clinical diagnosis and\\ntreatment, ethnobotany , pharmacognosy , phytotherapy ,\\nplant identification, ethical wildcrafting and cultivation,\\nand preparation and application of herbal remedies. Other\\nprograms are brief, geared more to the amateur herbalist\\nand gardener.

The annulus fibrosus surrounds a soft gel-like\\nsubstance in the center of the disk called the nucleus pul-\\nposus. Pressure from the vertebrae above and below may\\ncause the nucleus pulposus to be forced against the sides\\nof the annulus. The constant pressure of the nucleus\\nagainst the sides of the annulus will cause the fibers of\\nthe annulus to break down. As the fibers of the annulus\\nbreak down, the nucleus will push toward the outside of\\nthe annulus and cause the disk to bulge in the direction\\nof the pressure. This condition most frequently occurs in\\nthe lumbar region and is also commonly called a herniat-\\ned nucleus pulposus, prolapsed disk, ruptured disk, or a\\nslipped disk.\\nDescription\\nThe spinal column is made up of 24 vertebrae that\\nare joined together and permit forward and backward\\nbending, side bending, and rotation of the spine. There\\nare seven cervical (neck), twelve thoracic (chest region),\\nand five lumbar (low back) vertebra. There are interver-\\ntebral disks between each of the 24 vertebrae as well as a\\ndisk between the lowest lumbar vertebrae and the large\\nbone at the base of the spine called the sacrum.\\nDisk herniation most commonly affects the lumbar re-\\ngion. However, disk herniation can also occur in the cervi-\\ncal spine. The incidence of cervical disk herniation is most\\ncommon between the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae.\\nThe second most common area for cervical disk herniation\\noccurs between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae.\\nDisk herniation is uncommon in the thoracic region.\\nThe peak age for occurrence of disk herniation is\\nbetween 20 and 45 years of age. Studies have shown that\\nmales are more commonly affected than females in lum-\\nbar disk herniation by a 3:2 ratio. Long periods of sitting\\nor a bent-forward work posture may lead to an increased\\nincidence of disk herniation.\\nThere are four classifications of disk pathology:\\n• A protrusion occurs when a disk bulges without ruptur-\\ning the annulus fibrosus.\\n• A prolapse occurs when the nucleus pulposus pushes to\\nthe outermost fibers of the annulus fibrosus but does\\nnot break through them.\\n• An extrusion occurs when the outermost layer of the\\nannulus fibrosus is torn and the material of the nucleus\\nmoves into the epidural space.\\n• A sequestration occurs when fragments from the annu-\\nlus fibrosus or the nucleus pulposus have broken free\\nand lie outside the confines of the disk.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAny direct or, forceful in a vertical direction pres-\\nsure on the disks can cause the disk to push its nucleus\\ninto the fibers of the annulus or into the intervertebral\\ncanal. A herniated disk may occur suddenly from lifting,\\ntwisting, or direct injury , but more often it will occur\\nfrom constant compressive loads over time. There may\\nbe a single incident that causes symptoms to be felt, but\\nvery often the disk was already damaged and bulging\\nprior to any one particular incident.\\nDepending on the location of the herniation, the her-\\nniated material can also press directly on nerve roots or\\non the spinal cord. Pressure on the nerve roots or spinal\\ncord may cause a shock-like pain sensation down the\\narms if the herniation is in the cervical vertebrae or down\\nthe legs if the herniation is in the lumbar region.\\nIn the lumbar region a herniation that presses on the\\nnerve roots or the spinal cord may also cause weakness,\\nnumbness, or problems with bowels, bladder, or sexual\\nfunction. It is unclear if a herniated disk causes pain by\\nitself without pressing on neurological structures. It is\\nlikely that irritation of the disk or the adjacent nerve\\nroots may cause muscle spasm and pain in the region of\\nthe disk pathology .\\nDiagnosis\\nSeveral radiographic tests are useful for confirming\\na diagnosis of disk herniation and locating the source of\\npain. X rays show structural changes of the lumbar\\nspine. Myelography is a special x ray of the spine in\\nwhich a dye or air is injected into the patient’s spinal\\ncanal. The patient lies strapped to a table as the table tilts\\nin various directions and spot x rays are taken. X rays\\nshowing a narrowed dye column in the intervertebral\\ndisk area indicate possible disk herniation.\\nComputed tomography scan (CT scans) exhibit the\\ndetails of pathology necessary to obtain consistently\\ngood treatment results. Magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI) analysis of the disks can accurately detect the\\nearly stages of disk aging and degeneration. Electromyo-\\ngrams (EMGs) measure the electrical activity of the\\nmuscle contractions and possibly show evidence of\\nnerve damage.\\nA number of physical examination procedures may\\nbe used to determine if a herniated disk is pressing on a\\nnerve root. While these tests may not identify the defini-\\ntive presence of a herniated disk, they are very useful for\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 955\\nHerniated disk\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 955'),\n",

Mobilizing the spine will help\\nthe patient get back to moderate activity levels sooner.\\nThe earlier an individual can return to moderate activity\\nlevels, the quicker they can expect a resolution of their\\nsymptoms. Chiropractic manipulations are generally\\ndone with a greater frequency when a condition is in an\\nacute stage. The frequency of treatments will be reduced\\nas the condition improves.\\nOsteopathic therapy , considered by some to be an\\nalternative treatment, may use manipulations or manual\\ntherapy techniques very similar to those of chiropractors.\\nHowever, osteopathic physicians often employ more\\nmanual therapy techniques that focus on the role of the\\nmuscles and other soft tissues in producing pain sensa-\\ntions with herniated disks. Osteopathic physicians may\\nalso recommend use of the same medications prescribed\\nby allopathic physicians. Some osteopaths also perform\\nsurgery for herniated disks.\\nindicating if there is pressure on a nerve root from some\\nstructure such as a herniated disk. The straight leg raise\\ntest may be used to identify pressure on nerve roots in\\nthe lumbar region while the Spurling’s test (involving\\nneck motion) may be used to identify compression of\\nnerve roots in the cervical region. Compression of nerve\\nroots in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar regions may be\\napparent with the slump test.\\nT reatment\\nIt is unclear if herniated disks cause pain themselves,\\nor if they must press on a nerve root to cause pain. Pain\\nmay also occur with herniated disks as a result of me-\\nchanical or neurological irritation of surrounding struc-\\ntures such as muscles, tendons, ligaments, or joint cap-\\nsules. Therefore, many treatment strategies will be pri-\\nmarily focused on managing symptoms that occur in con-\\njunction with a herniated disk. Unless a serious\\nneurological problem exists, most symptoms of a herniat-\\ned disk will resolve on their own. Y et, the interventions\\nlisted below may greatly speed the time required to re-\\nsolve symptoms associated with a herniated disk.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 956'),\n",

Neurological irri-\\ntation is considered to be a frequent source of pain with a\\nherniated disk. Many believe acupuncture is particularly\\neffective for pain management and addressing this neu-\\nrological irritation. Acupuncture can also help break the\\ncycle of pain and muscle spasm that often accompanies a\\nherniated disk.\\nMassage therapists focus on muscular reactions to\\nthe herniated disk. Neurological irritation that comes\\nwith a herniated disk will often cause excessive muscle\\nspasms in the lower back muscles. These spasms will\\nperpetuate dysfunctional movements in the joints of the\\nspine and may exaggerate compressive forces on the in-\\ntervertebral disk. By relaxing the muscles, massage ther-\\napists will attempt to manage the symptoms of disk her-\\nniation until proper movement can be restored. Proper\\nmovement and avoidance of aggravating postures, like\\nsitting for long periods, will often be a great help in com-\\npletely resolving the symptoms.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nUnless serious neurologic symptoms occur, herniat-\\ned disks can initially be treated with pain medication.\\nPain medications, including anti-inflammatories, muscle\\nrelaxants, or in severe cases, narcotics, may be used if\\nneeded. Bed rest is sometimes prescribed. However, bed\\nrest is frequently discouraged as a treatment for herniat-\\ned disks unless movement is severely painful. It has be-\\ncome apparent that prolonged periods of bed rest may\\naggravate symptoms, slow down the healing time, and\\ncause other complications.\\nEpidural steroid injections have been used to decrease\\npain by injecting an anti-inflammatory drug, usually a corti-\\ncosteroid, around the nerve root to reduce inflammation and\\nedema (swelling). This treatment partly relieves the pres-\\nsure on the nerve root as well as resolves the inflammation.\\nPhysical therapists are skilled in treating acute back\\npain caused by disk herniation. The physical therapist\\ncan provide noninvasive therapies, such as ultrasound or\\ndiathermy, to project heat deep into the tissues of the\\nback or administer manual therapy , if mobility of the\\nspine is impaired. They may help improve posture and\\ndevelop an exercise program for recovery and long-term\\nprotection. Traction can be used to decrease pressure on\\nthe disk. A lumbar support can be helpful for a herniated\\ndisk at this level as a temporary measure to reduce pain\\nand improve posture.\\nSurgery may be used for conditions that do not im-\\nprove with conservative treatment. There are several sur-\\ngical approaches to treating a herniated disk. A number\\nof surgical procedures may be used to remove a portion\\nof the intervertebral disk that may be pressing on a nerve\\nroot. When a portion of the disk is removed through a\\nsurgical procedure it is called a discectomy . Sometimes a\\nspinal fusion will be performed after disk material has\\nbeen removed. In this process a portion of bone is taken\\nfrom the pelvis and placed between the bodies of the ver-\\ntebrae. A spinal fusion will limit motion at that vertebral\\nsegment, but may be helpful in the event that significant\\ndisk material has been removed.\\nChemonucleolysis is an alternative to surgical re-\\nmoval of the disk. Chymopapain, a purified enzyme de-\\nrived from the papaya plant, is injected into the disk\\nspace to reduce the size of the herniated disks. The reduc-\\ntion in size of the disk relieves pressure on the nerve root.\\nIn 2002, T okyo doctors produced evidence that a growth\\nfactor called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\\nmay speed up the process of injured disk resorption.\\nIn September 2002, a noted orthopedic and spine\\nauthority named John Engelhardt became the first Amer-\\nican to receive an artificial disk replacement (using the\\nBristol disk) in an operation in Switzerland. The artifi-\\ncial disk technology was still in clinical trials in the\\nUnited States and was not expected to be approved until\\nabout 2005 or later.\\nExpected results\\nOnly a small percentage of patients with unrelenting\\nneurological involvement, leading to chronic pain of the\\nspine, need to have a surgical procedure performed. This\\nfact strongly suggests that many patients with herniated\\ndisks respond well to conservative treatment. Alternative\\ntherapies can play a significant role in managing the pain\\nand discomfort for the majority of patients with a herni-\\nated disk. In fact, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\\nstudies of the lumbar spine have indicated that many\\npeople without any back pain at all have herniated disks.\\nThis finding means it is unclear what role the herniated\\ndisk plays in many back pain cases. For many of these\\npatients, proper symptom management of pain and im-\\nprovement in joint motion and mobility through manual\\ntherapies will be enough to fully resolve their symptoms.\\nFor those patients who do require surgery , options are\\navailable for newer and less invasive procedures that will\\nallow a quicker healing time.\\nPrevention\\nProper exercises to strengthen the lower back and\\nabdominal muscles are key in preventing excess stress\\nand compressive forces on lumbar disks.

With a hiatal hernia, the stomach bulges up-\\nward through the esophageal hiatus (the hole through\\nwhich the esophagus passes) of the diaphragm. This type\\nof hernia occurs more often in women than in men, and\\nit is treated differently from other types of hernias.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nA hiatal hernia may be caused by obesity, pregnan-\\ncy, aging, or previous surgery . About 50% of all people\\nwith hiatal hernias do not have any symptoms. For those\\nwho do have symptoms, they include heartburn, usually\\n30–60 minutes after a meal, or mid-chest pain due to\\ngastric acid from the stomach being pushed up into the\\nesophagus. The pain and heartburn are usually worse\\nwhen lying down. Frequent belching and feelings of ab-\\ndominal fullness may also occur.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis for a hiatal hernia is based on a per-\\nson’s reported symptoms. The doctor may then order tests\\nto confirm the diagnosis. If a barium swallow is ordered,\\nthe person drinks a chalky white barium solution, which\\nwill help any protrusion through the diaphragm to show\\nup on the x ray that follows.

Occasionally , a\\nbout of hiccups will last longer than two days, earning it\\nthe name “persistent hiccups. ” V ery few people will ex-\\nperience intractable hiccups, in which hiccups last longer\\nthan one month.\\nA hiccup involves the coordinated action of the di-\\naphragm and the muscles that close off the windpipe\\n(trachea). The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle sepa-\\nrating the chest and abdomen. It is normally responsible\\nfor expanding the chest cavity for inhalation. Sensation\\nfrom the diaphragm travels to the spinal cord through the\\nphrenic nerve and the vagus nerve, which pass through\\nthe chest cavity and the neck. Within the spinal cord,\\nnerve fibers from the brain monitor sensory information\\nand adjust the outgoing messages that control contrac-\\ntion. These messages travel along the phrenic nerve.\\nIrritation of any of the nerves involved in this loop\\ncan cause the diaphragm to undergo an involuntary con-\\ntraction, or spasm, pulling air into the lungs. When this\\nspasm occurs, it triggers a reflex in the throat muscles.\\nLess than a tenth of a second afterward, the trachea is\\nclosed off, making the characteristic “hic” sound.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nHiccups can be caused by disorders of the central\\nnervous system, by injury or irritation to the phrenic and\\nvagus nerves, and by toxic or metabolic disorders affect-\\ning the central or peripheral nervous systems. They may\\nbe of unknown cause or may be a symptom of psycho-\\nlogical stress . Hiccups often occur after drinking car-\\nbonated beverages or alcohol. They may also follow\\novereating or rapid temperature changes. Persistent or\\nintractable hiccups may be caused by any condition that\\nirritates or damages the relevant nerves, including:\\n• overstretching of the neck\\n• laryngitis\\n• heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux)\\n• irritation of the eardrum (which is innervated by the\\nvagus nerve)\\n• general anesthesia\\n• surgery\\n• bloating\\n• tumor\\n• infection\\n• diabetes\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2962\\nHiccups\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAbortifacient —A substance that induces abor-\\ntions.\\nAnthelminthic—A medication that destroys or ex-\\npels parasitic worms from the digestive tract.\\nAntispasmodic—A medication that prevents or re-\\nlieves involuntary muscular cramps.\\nEmollient—A substance that softens and smoothes\\nthe skin.\\nFebrifuge—A substance or medication that lowers\\nor dispels fevers.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 962'),\n",

Insoluble fiber\\nspeeds up the movement of foods through the digestive\\nsystem and adds bulk to the stools; it helps to treat con-\\nstipation or diarrhea and prevents colon cancer. On the\\nother hand, only soluble fiber can lower blood choles-\\nterol levels. This type of fiber works by attaching itself\\nto the cholesterol so that it can be eliminated from the\\nbody . This process prevents cholesterol from recirculat-\\ning and being reabsorbed into the bloodstream.\\nOrigins\\nHigh-fiber diet therapy is actually a return to nature\\nand the plant-based diets used by our ancestors since the\\nbeginning of time. In fact, our ancestors consumed large\\nquantities of fiber-containing foods such as fruits, veg-\\netables and whole grain products every day . As technolo-\\ngy advanced, however, people began to turn away from\\nthese unprocessed healthful foods and began eating more\\nhighly processed and fat-laden foods. As a result, the in-\\ncidence of coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancers\\nhas steadily risen. Naturopathic physicians, who practice\\nnatural healing methods, have long advocated high-fiber\\ndiets as a major preventive and therapeutic treatment for\\nthese and other diseases. Extensive medical research has\\nnow confirmed that a high-fiber diet prevents or treats a\\nwide variety of diseases ranging from constipation to\\nheart disease and cancer.\\nBenefits\\nA high-fiber diet helps prevent or treat the following\\nhealth conditions:\\n• High blood cholesterol levels. Fiber effectively lowers\\nblood cholesterol levels. It appears that soluble fiber\\nbinds to the cholesterol molecule and moves it through\\nthe digestive tract so that it can be excreted from the\\nbody . This mechanism prevents cholesterol from being\\nreabsorbed into the bloodstream. In 2003, research con-\\nfirmed the long-term effects of high-fiber diets on low-\\nering bad cholesterol in people with T ype II diabetes.\\n• Constipation. A high-fiber diet is a useful non-drug\\ntreatment for constipation. Fiber in the diet adds more\\nbulk to the stools, making them softer. Fiber also short-\\nens the length of time that foods remain in the digestive\\ntract. It is important, however, for people increasing\\ntheir fiber intake to drink more water as well, in order\\nto get the benefit of using dietary fiber to relieve consti-\\npation.\\n• Hemorrhoids . Fiber in the diet adds more bulk and\\nsoftens the stool, thus reducing the pain and bleeding\\nassociated with hemorrhoids.\\n• Diabetes. A common problem for diabetics is the rapid\\nrise of insulin levels following meals. Soluble fiber in\\nthe diet delays the emptying of the stomach contents\\ninto the intestines. This delay helps to slow the rise of\\nblood sugar levels following a meal and thus gives dia-\\nbetics greater control over their condition.\\n• Obesity . Dietary fiber makes a person feel full more\\nrapidly . It can thus help a person lose weight by mak-\\ning the appetite easier to control.\\n• Colon and colorectal cancer. Insoluble fiber in the diet\\nspeeds up the movement of the stools through the gas-\\ntrointestinal tract. The faster that food and its byprod-\\nucts travel through the digestive tract, the less time\\nthere is for potential cancer-causing substances to work\\non the food. Diets that are high in insoluble fiber help\\nto prevent the accumulation of toxic substances that\\ncause cancer of the colon.\\n• Breast cancer . A high dietary consumption of fats is\\nassociated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Be-\\ncause fiber reduces fat absorption in the digestive tract,\\nit may prevent breast cancer. In 2003, a study con-\\nfirmed these findings and showed that women who\\nconsumed more fiber and vitamin E also had a lower\\nrisk of developing benign breast disease, a condition\\nthat can lead to breast cancer.\\n• Prostate cancer. Though research is still relatively new ,\\nDr. Dean Ornish presented new data in April 2002 in a\\nstudy that showed how a high-fiber vegan diet could\\nslow or even stop prostate cancer for men in early stages\\nof the disease. Men who submitted to an extremely low-\\nfat vegan diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, whole\\ngrains, beans and soy products instead of dairy , and who\\ngave up alcohol and agreed to exercise three hours a\\nweek, relax and meditate one hour a day showed im-\\nprovements in markers for prostate cancer indicators.\\nPatients should not try this regimen unless they first dis-\\ncuss it with their doctors. In addition, it should comple-\\nment other physician–ordered treatments.\\nDescription\\nThe American Dietetic Association recommends\\neating 25–35 g of fiber daily . A person can meet this\\nfiber requirement by consuming two to three servings of\\nfruits and three to five servings of vegetables every day .\\nT o increase fiber intake, a person should eat more of the\\nfollowing high-fiber foods: whole grains, beans, fruits\\n(preferably with skins on), roots and leafy vegetables,\\nbroccoli or carrots. As an added bonus, he or she will\\nalso receive other health benefits provided by the vita-\\nmins, minerals, antioxidants and cancer-fighting phyto-\\nchemicals in these foods.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2964\\nHigh-fiber diet\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 964'),\n",

The test also measures the\\npresence of inflammation or infection.\\nOrigins\\nIn the late twentieth century , the primary methods of\\nmeasuring a person’s risk of heart disease included tradi-\\ntional factors such as age, family history of heart disease\\nor stroke, past heart disease, smoking, obesity, and tests\\nthat measured lipids in the bloodstream, including low-\\ndensity lipoprotein (LDL). Low-density lipoproteins\\n(“bad” cholesterol) were previously considered the gold\\nstandard in risk factor prediction.\\nIn the 1990s and early twenty-first century , several\\nnew tests came into widespread use. These tests are con-\\nsidered better predictors of heart disease risk. They in-\\nclude blood tests to measure the levels of homocysteine,\\nlipoprotein(a), fibrinogen, and highly sensitive C-reac-\\ntive protein. They are called emerging or nontraditional\\nrisk factors.\\nBenefits\\nKnowing one’s highly sensitive C-reactive protein\\nlevels can help a person manage and lower his or her risk\\nfor heart disease. Factors that lower highly sensitive CRP\\nlevels include weight loss, regular exercise , a healthy\\ndiet, and smoking cessation. Medicines may also be\\nneeded. Medications include a class of drugs called\\nstatins, with brand names such as Lipitor, Zocor, Crestor,\\nand Pravachol. Other interventions may include Zetia, a\\ncholesterol absorption inhibitor, and a class of drugs\\ncalled thiazoladinediones, such as the diabetes brand-\\nname medications A vandia and Actos.\\nAccording to the American Heart Association, the\\nthree risk levels associated with high sensitivity CRP\\nlevels are:\\n• Low risk: under 1 milligram per liter of blood.\\n• A verage risk: 1 to 3 milligrams per liter of blood.\\n• High risk: More than 3 milligrams per liter of blood.\\nDescription\\nC-reactive protein is produced by the liver and is not\\nnormally found in the blood in high amounts. It is rapidly\\nproduced following an injury , bacterial or fungal infec-\\ntion, or inflammation. It disappears quickly once the in-\\njury , illness, or inflammation heals or resolves. High CRP\\nlevels following surgery or an injury are a good indica-\\ntion that an infection is present. Until early in this centu-\\nry , the blood test used to detect CRP levels could only\\nmeasure them down to 3 milligrams per liter of blood or\\nhigher. Improvements in technology have permitted more\\nprecise measurements of CRP levels ranging from less\\nthan 0.3 milligrams to 3 milligrams per liter of blood. The\\nmore precise measurement is called the high sensitivity\\nC-reactive protein (hsCRP) test.\\nWhile levels under 3 milligrams per liter of blood do\\nnot necessarily indicate the presence of infection, they do\\nindicate the presence of an inflammatory reaction. Re-\\nsearchers found that these lower amounts of CRP in the\\nbody are extremely useful in predicting coronary heart\\ndisease (CHD). However, since CRP levels vary on dif-\\nferent days, at least two separate measurements are need-\\ned to adequately determine a person’s CHD risk level.\\nT o take the high sensitivity CRP test, a healthcare\\nworker draws blood from a vein, into a tube. In the labo-\\nratory , the tube of blood spins at high speed within a ma-\\nchine called a centrifuge. The blood cells sink to the bot-\\ntom and the liquid stays on the top. This straw-colored\\nliquid on the top is the plasma. T o measure the high sen-\\nsitivity CRP , a person’s plasma is combined with other\\nsubstances. From the resulting reaction, the amount of\\nCRP in the plasma is determined.\\nA study released in 2003 by the College of Ameri-\\ncan Pathologists found varying outcomes when it com-\\npared results from five different methods in identifying\\nhsCRP . A 2001 study by several university medical de-\\npartments found that six out of nine hsCRP testing meth-\\nods did not produce results as accurate as the manufac-\\nturers claimed. In 2003 the Centers for Disease Control\\nand Prevention announced that it would attempt to ad-\\ndress these issues.\\nPreparations\\nUnlike some blood tests that require fasting , the\\nhigh sensitivity C-reactive protein test can be done either\\nbefore or after eating. No other preparations are needed.\\nEach high sensitivity CRP test requires a 5-milliliter\\nblood sample. A healthcare worker usually ties a tight\\nband (tourniquet) on the person’s upper arm. The blood\\nis drawn from a vein in the arm, usually at the inside of\\nthe elbow or on the back of the hand. The needle inser-\\ntion site is cleaned with antiseptic. A small needle is in-\\nserted through the skin and into the vein, allowing the\\nblood sample to flow into a collection tube or syringe.\\nOnce the blood is collected, the needle is removed from\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2966\\nHigh sensitivity C-reactive protein test\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 966'),\n",

W ells\\nHIV infection see AIDS\\nHives\\nDefinition\\nHives are an allergic skin reaction causing localized\\nredness, swelling, and itching.\\nDescription\\nHives are a reaction of the body’s immune system\\nthat causes areas of the skin to swell, itch, and become\\nreddened. (The affected areas are called wheals.) When\\nthe reaction is limited to small areas of the skin, it is\\ncalled urticaria. Involvement of larger areas, such as\\nwhole sections of a limb, is called angioedema.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nCauses\\nHives are an allergic reaction. The body’s immune\\nsystem is normally responsible for protection from for-\\neign invaders. When it becomes sensitized to normally\\nharmless substances, the resulting reaction is called an\\nallergy . An attack of hives is set off when such a sub-\\nstance, called an allergen, is ingested, inhaled, or other-\\nwise contacted. It interacts with immune cells called\\nmast cells, which reside in the skin, airways, and diges-\\ntive system. When mast cells encounter an allergen, they\\nrelease histamine and other chemicals, both locally and\\ninto the bloodstream. These chemicals cause blood ves-\\nsels to become more porous, allowing fluid to accumu-\\nlate in tissue and leading to the swollen and reddish ap-\\npearance of hives. Some of the chemicals released sensi-\\ntize pain-related nerve endings, causing the affected\\narea to become itchy and sensitive.\\nA wide variety of substances may cause hives in\\nsensitive people. Common culprits include:\\n• prescription and nonprescription drugs (Aspirin and\\npenicillin are the two most commonly known causes of\\nallergic reactions in adults.)\\n• nuts, especially peanuts, walnuts, and Brazil nuts\\n• fish, mollusks, and shellfish\\n• eggs\\n• wheat\\n• milk\\n• strawberries\\n• food additives and preservatives\\n• influenza vaccines\\n• tetanus toxoid vaccine\\n• gamma globulin\\n• bee, wasp, and hornet stings\\n• bites of mosquitoes, fleas, and scabies.\\nIn addition, hives may also result from the body’s\\nresponse to certain physical conditions, such as emotion-\\nal stress, rubbing, cold wind, heat contact ( prickly heat\\nrash), wearing tight clothing, or exercise after a heavy\\nmeal.\\nSymptoms\\nUrticaria is characterized by redness, swelling, and\\nitching of small areas of the skin. These patches usually\\ngrow and recede in less than a day , but may be replaced\\nby others in other locations. Angioedema is character-\\nized by more diffuse swelling. Swelling of the airways\\nmay cause wheezing and respiratory distress. In severe\\ncases, airway obstruction may occur.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2968\\nHives\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 968'),\n",

Odle\\nHodgkin’ s disease\\nDefinition\\nHodgkin’s disease, also called Hodgkin’s lym-\\nphoma, is a type of cancer involving tissues of the lym-\\nphatic system, or lymph nodes. Its cause is unknown, al-\\nthough some interaction between individual genetic\\nmakeup, family history , environmental exposures, and\\ninfectious agents is suspected.\\nDescription\\nHodgkin’s lymphoma can occur at any age, al-\\nthough the majority of these lymphomas occur in people\\naged 15–34, and over the age of 60. Lymphoma is a can-\\ncer of the lymphatic system. Depending on the specific\\ntype, a lymphoma can have any or all of the characteris-\\ntics of cancer: rapid multiplication of cells, abnormal\\ncell types, loss of normal arrangement of cells with re-\\nspect to one another, and invasive ability .\\nCauses & symptoms\\nHodgkin’s lymphoma usually begins in a lymph\\nnode. The node enlarges and—similar to enlarged lymph\\nnodes due to infectious causes—may or may not cause\\nany pain. Hodgkin’s lymphoma progresses in a fairly pre-\\ndictable way , traveling from one group of lymph nodes to\\nanother unless it is treated. More advanced cases of\\nHodgkin’s involve the spleen, liver, and bone marrow .\\nThe features and prognosis of patients with\\nHodgkin’s disease and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)\\ndiffer significantly . However, research in 2001 found that\\namong patients with human immunodeficiency virus\\n(HIV), Hodgkin’s disease appears very similar to HIV -\\nrelated non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. NHL occurs much\\nmore often in patients with HIV , but in recent years, a\\nsmall but significant increase in Hodgkin’s disease has\\nbeen seen in HIV -infected patients.\\nConstitutional symptoms—symptoms that affect the\\nwhole body—are common. They include fever, weight\\nloss, heavy sweating at night, and itching. Some patients\\nnote pain after drinking alcoholic beverages.\\nAs the lymph nodes swell, they may push against\\nnearby structures, resulting in other local symptoms. These\\nsymptoms include pain from pressure on nerve roots as\\nwell as loss of function of specific muscle groups served\\nby the compressed nerves. Kidney failure may result from\\ncompression of the ureters, the tubes which carry urine\\nfrom the kidneys to the bladder. The face, neck, or arms\\nmay swell due to pressure slowing the flow in veins that\\nshould drain blood from those regions (superior vena cava\\nsyndrome). Pressure on the spinal cord can result in leg\\nparalysis. Compression of the trachea and/or bronchi (air-\\nways) can cause wheezing and shortness of breath. Masses\\nin the liver can cause the accumulation of certain chemi-\\ncals in the blood, resulting in jaundice—a yellowish discol-\\noration of the skin and the whites of the eyes.\\nAs Hodgkin’s lymphoma progresses, a patient’s im-\\nmune system becomes less and less effective at fighting\\ninfection. Thus, patients with Hodgkin’ s lymphoma be-\\ncome increasingly more susceptible to both common in-\\nfections caused by bacteria and unusual (opportunistic)\\ninfections caused by viruses, fungi, and protozoa.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of Hodgkin’ s lymphoma requires the re-\\nmoval of a sample of a suspicious lymph node (biopsy)\\nand careful examination of the tissue under a micro-\\nscope. In Hodgkin’s lymphoma, certain characteristic\\ncells—Reed-Sternberg cells—must be present in order to\\nconfirm the diagnosis. These cells usually contain two or\\nmore nuclei—oval centrally-located structures within\\ncells that house their genetic material. In addition to the\\nidentification of these Reed-Sternberg cells, other cells\\nin the affected tissue sample are examined. The charac-\\nteristics of these other cells help to classify the specific\\nsubtype of Hodgkin’s lymphoma.\\nOnce Hodgkin’s disease has been diagnosed, staging\\nis the next important step. Staging involves computed to-\\nmography (CT) scans of the abdomen, chest, and pelvis,\\nto identify areas of lymph node involvement. In rare\\ncases, a patient must undergo abdominal surgery so that\\nlymph nodes in the abdominal area can be biopsied (stag-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2970\\nHodgkin’ s disease\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAllergen —A substance capable of producing an\\nimmediate type of hypersensitivity , or allergy .\\nWheal —A smooth, slightly elevated area on the\\nbody surface, which is redder or paler than the\\nsurrounding skin.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 970'),\n",

Some patients have their spleens re-\\nmoved during this surgery , both to help with staging and\\nto remove a focus of the disease. Bone marrow biopsy is\\nalso required unless there is obvious evidence of vital\\norgan involvement. Some physicians also order a lym-\\nphangiogram—a radiograph of the lymphatic vessels.\\nStaging is important because it helps to determine\\nwhat kind of treatment a patient should receive. On one\\nhand, it is important to understand the stage of the disease\\nso that the treatment chosen is sufficiently strong to pro-\\nvide the patient with a cure. On the other hand, all the\\navailable treatments have serious side effects, so staging al-\\nlows the patient to have the type of treatment necessary to\\nachieve a cure, and to minimize the severity of short and\\nlong-term side effects from which the patient may suffer.\\nT reatment\\nHodgkin’s disease is a life-threatening disease. A\\ncorrect diagnosis and appropriate treatment with surgery ,\\nchemotherapy , and/or radiation therapy are critical to\\ncontrolling the illness.\\nAcupuncture, hypnotherapy, and guided imagery\\nmay be useful tools in treating pain symptoms associated\\nwith Hodgkin’s. Acupuncture involves the placement of\\na series of thin needles into the skin at targeted locations\\non the body known as acupoints in order to harmonize\\nthe energy flow within the human body .\\nIn guided imagery , the patient creates pleasant and\\ncomfortable mental images that promote relaxation and\\nimprove a patient’s ability to cope with discomfort and\\npain symptoms. Other guided imagery techniques involve\\ncreating a visual mental image of the pain. Once the pain\\ncan be visualized, the patient can adjust the image to\\nmake it more pleasing and thus more manageable.\\nA number of herbal remedies are also available to\\nlessen pain symptoms and promote relaxation and heal-\\ning. However, individuals should consult with their\\nhealthcare professionals before taking them. Depending\\non the preparation and the type of herb, these remedies\\nmay interact with or enhance the effects of other pre-\\nscribed medications.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nTreatment of Hodgkin’s lymphoma has become in-\\ncreasingly effective over the years. The type of treatment\\nused for Hodgkin’s depends on the information obtained\\nby staging, and may include chemotherapy (treatment\\nwith a combination of drugs), and/or radiotherapy (treat-\\nment with radiation to kill cancer cells).\\nBoth chemotherapy and radiation therapy have unfortu-\\nnate side effects. Chemotherapy can result in nausea, vom-\\niting, hair loss, and increased susceptibility to infection. Ra-\\ndiation therapy can cause sore throat, difficulty in swallow-\\ning, diarrhea, and growth abnormalities in children. Both\\nforms of treatment, especially in combination, can result in\\nsterility (the permanent inability to have offspring), as well\\nas heart and lung damage. A 2003 study showed a link be-\\ntween radiation therapy for Hodgkin’s disease and increased\\nrisk for later breast cancer. However, adding chemotherapy\\nto the regimen decreased the chance for breast cancer, per-\\nhaps by inducing premature menopause.\\nExpected results\\nHodgkin’s is one of the most curable forms of cancer.\\nCurrent treatments are quite effective, especially with\\nearly diagnosis. Children have a particularly high rate of\\ncure from the disease, with about 75% still living cancer-\\nfree 20 years after their original diagnosis. Adults with the\\nmost severe form of the disease have about a 50% cure\\nrate. In 2003, new research noted that even after complete\\nremission, some patients showed signs of thyroid dysfunc-\\ntion, most likely from the immune problems caused by\\nHodgkin’s disease. The researchers recommended thyroid\\nexaminations every year during follow-up of the disease.\\nPrevention\\nWhile Hodgkin’s disease cannot be prevented, re-\\nsearchers continue to study risk factors for the disease.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 971'),\n",

Odle\\nHolistic dentistry\\nDefinition\\nHolistic dentistry , also referred to as biologic den-\\ntistry , is an alternative approach that focuses on the use\\nof non-toxic restorative materials for dental work, and\\nemphasizes the unrecognized impact that dental toxins\\nand dental infections may have on a person’s overall\\nhealth. While traditional dentistry focuses only on the\\nareas above the neck, holistic dentistry looks at the pa-\\ntient as a whole system and how the mouth relates to the\\nrest of the body .\\nOrigins\\nApplying a biological concept to the practice of\\ndentistry began in the late 1800s, when the National\\nDental Association recognized the harmful effects of\\nmercury (amalgam) fillings, and mandated that members\\nof the association not use these on their patients. As of\\n1997, this warning has been recognized and acted upon\\nby several foreign countries that have either banned the\\nuse of mercury in fillings or are in the process of doing\\nso. Supporters of holistic dentistry state that mercury in\\namalgam fillings causes ill effects when placed as an im-\\nplant in the body .\\nFurther beginnings of holistic dentistry are linked to\\na 1925 article by the dentist W eston A. Price\\n(1870–1948). A former director of research for the\\nAmerican Dental Association, Price claimed in an article\\nfor the Journal of the American Medical Association that\\nsuch degenerative diseases as heart troubles, kidney and\\nbladder disorders, arthritis, rheumatism, mental illness,\\nlung problems, and several kinds of bacterial infections\\narise from root canal therapy , or endodontics. T o come to\\nthis conclusion, Price conducted research that involved\\nimplanting teeth from the root canals of individuals with\\nsymptoms of severe heart problems and kidney disease\\nunder the skin of healthy rabbits. These same conditions\\narose in the rabbits, and within three days they died.\\nPrice then implanted the same tooth in another rabbit and\\nfound a similar response, but he also found that implanti-\\nng a normal extracted tooth did not affect the rabbits.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2972\\nHolistic dentistry\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nBiopsy—The removal of a small sample of tissue, in\\norder to carefully examine it under a microscope.\\nThis procedure helps in the diagnosis of cancer ,\\nand can also reveal infection or inflammation.\\nChemotherapy—T reatment for a disease involving\\nvarious chemical or drug preparations; this term\\ntends to refer to treatment for forms of cancer in\\nparticular .\\nConstitutional—Involving the whole body .

Those who practice this form\\nof biologic dentistry claim that it is aesthetic, relatively\\nnontoxic, and individually biocompatible, or life sup-\\nporting. A holistic dentist uses physiologic and electron-\\nic methods to locate areas of chronic disease that are dif-\\nficult to locate by current standard methods.\\nThe benefits of holistic dentistry are said to be the\\nresult of its incorporation of hypnosis, homeopathy , aro-\\nmatherapy, nutrition, and herbology .\\nHypnosis\\nWhen hypnosis is used, patients are able to relax\\ntheir bodies and minds by concentrating on suggestions\\nof relaxation . The patient is fully aware of what is hap-\\npening during their treatment and no drugs are used.\\nMany holistic dentists employ specialist hypnotherapists\\nto provide treatment that is highly effective and cannot\\ncause any harm or produce any side effects.\\nHomeopathy\\nHomeopathy is used by holistic dentists as a natural\\napproach to their practice. The therapy is a safe and nat-\\nural alternative that is nonaddictive and effective with\\nboth adults and children. Homeopathic remedies are used\\nto improve the psychological or emotional condition of\\npatients without the drugging effects of conventional\\ntranquilizers. The three main remedies considered by\\nholistic dentists include: aconite (foxglove); gelsemium\\n(yellow jasmine); and argentum nitricum (silver nitrate).\\nAromatherapy\\nAromatherapy uses the pure oil essences from plants\\nand flowers that act as hormone-like stimulants to im-\\nprove a patient’s health balance. Used because they are\\nnatural and gentle, oils like lavender, bergamot, sandal-\\nwood, and basil are beneficial in their power to soothe,\\nrelax, and calm. Some holistic dentists use these oils to\\nmake their offices more inviting to the patient.\\nNutrition\\nHolistic dentists believe that stress and tension are\\noften linked to diet. Dietary excesses or deficiencies in-\\ncrease the body’s needs for essential vitamins and miner-\\nals, and the stress and tension accelerate any fears or\\nphobias of the patient.\\nBotanical medicine & herbal medicine\\nHolistic dentistry may use herbs to promote relax-\\nation.

An additional biological concern is\\n“oral galvanism, ” or the direct electrical currents generat-\\ned by separated metals throughout fluids and tissues in\\nthe body . Hidden or residual infection, or the abnormal\\nchanges in the soft connective tissue containing dental\\nmaterial that cannot be processed, is believed to cause\\nlocal and general defenses that put the body in a continu-\\nous state of active conflict, often leading to chronic dis-\\nease.\\nAccording to those who practice holistic dentistry ,\\nthere may be several major types of dental problems that\\ncan cause illness or dysfunction in the body , including:\\n• silver (amalgam) fillings that typically contain 50%\\nmercury silver\\n• root canals\\n• cavitations, or neuralgia-inducing cavitational os-\\nteonecrosis (NICO), a term coined by the oral patholo-\\ngist J.E.

Be-\\nlievers in biologic dentistry claim that root canal-treated\\nteeth cause NICO and other chronic systemic diseases\\nand require removal of all these teeth and the healthy\\nteeth surrounding them. Critics state that these extreme\\nmeasures are bizarre and dangerous. According to a\\n1994 article in Milwaukee Magazine , a group of local\\npatients filed suit against several holistic practitioners\\nwho had removed several of their perfectly healthy teeth\\nafter guaranteeing improvement of their diseases. These\\npatients experienced no relief from their ongoing health\\nproblems after the extractions.\\nSide effects\\nCertain side effects have been reported as a result of\\ntreatments used by holistic dentists. Patients who were\\ntreated with auriculotherapy, or acupuncture of the ear,\\nhave experienced complications from unsterile needles.\\nWhen correcting a “bad bite, ” holistic dentists often\\nplace a plastic appliance called a mandibular orthopedic\\nrepositioning appliance (MORA) between the teeth. The\\nlong-term use of MORAs has been reported to cause the\\npatient’s teeth to move out of proper alignment, leading\\nto the need for orthodontics or facial reconstructive\\nsurgery to correct the deformity .\\nWith amalgam fillings being one of the main con-\\ncerns of holistic dentists, many have turned to using non-\\ntoxic composite materials, but these too have come\\nunder scrutiny . The plastics used in the composites have\\nbeen linked to leaching compounds that may be danger-\\nous to health.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nWhile dentistry has been reportedly undergoing a\\nquiet revolution with the emergence of holistic dentists,\\ntheir complementary methods remain under criticism.

That is,\\ninstead of treating an illness, as in orthodox allopathy ,\\nholistic medicine looks at an individual’s overall physi-\\ncal, mental, spiritual, and emotional well-being before\\nrecommending treatment. A practitioner with a holistic\\napproach treats the symptoms of illness as well as look-\\ning for the underlying cause of the illness. Holistic medi-\\ncine also attempts to prevent illness by placing a greater\\nemphasis on optimizing health. The body’s systems are\\nseen as interdependent parts of the person’s whole being.\\nThe body’s natural state is one of health, and an illness or\\ndisease is an imbalance in the body’s systems.

Their techniques are noninvasive.\\nSome of the world’s health systems that are holistic\\nin nature include naturopathic medicine, homeopathy,\\nand traditional Chinese medicine . Many alternative or\\nnatural therapies have a holistic approach, although that\\nis not always the case. The term complementary medi-\\ncine is used to refer to the use of both allopathic and\\nholistic treatments. It is more often used in Great Britain\\nbut is gaining acceptance in the United States.\\nThere are no limits to the range of diseases and dis-\\norders that can be treated in a holistic way , as the princi-\\nple of holistic healing is to balance the body , mind, spir-\\nit, and emotions so that the person’s whole being func-\\ntions smoothly . When an individual seeks holistic treat-\\nment for a particular illness or condition, other health\\nproblems improve without direct treatment due to im-\\nprovement in the performance of the immune system,\\nwhich is one of the goals of holistic medicine.\\nOrigins\\nThe concept of holistic medicine is not new . In the\\n4th century BC, Socrates warned that treating only one\\npart of the body would not have good results. Hip-\\npocrates considered that many factors contribute to the\\nhealth or otherwise of a human being, including weather,\\nnutrition, emotional factors. In our time, a host of differ-\\nent sources of pollution can interfere with health. And of\\ncourse, holistic medicine existed even before older\\nGreece in some ancient healing traditions, such as those\\nfrom India and China, which date back over 5,000 years.\\nHowever, the term “holistic” only became part of every-\\nday language in the 1970s, when W esterners began seek-\\ning an alternative to allopathic medicine.\\nInterestingly , it was only at the beginning of the twen-\\ntieth century that the principles of holistic medicine fell out\\nof favor in W estern societies, with the advent of major ad-\\nvances in what we now call allopathic medicine. Paradoxi-\\ncally , many discoveries of the twentieth century have only\\nserved to confirm many natural medicine theories. In many\\ncases, researchers have set out to debunk holistic medicine,\\nonly to find that their research confirms it, as has been the\\ncase, for example, with many herbal remedies.\\nBenefits\\nMany people are now turning to holistic medicine,\\noften when suffering from chronic ailments that have not\\nbeen successfully treated by allopathic means. Although\\nmany wonderful advances and discoveries have been made\\nin modern medicine, surgery and drugs alone have a very\\npoor record for producing optimal health because they are\\ndesigned to attack illness. Holistic medicine is particularly\\nhelpful in treating chronic illnesses and maintaining health\\nthrough proper nutrition and stress management.\\nDescription\\nThere are a number of therapies that come under the\\numbrella of holistic medicine. They all use basically the\\nsame principles, promoting not only physical health, but\\nalso mental, emotional, and spiritual health. Most em-\\nphasize quality nutrition. Refined foods typically eaten\\nin modern America contain chemical additives and\\npreservatives, are high in fat, cholesterol , and sugars,\\nand promote disease. Alternative nutritionists counter re-\\nfined foods by recommending whole foods whenever\\npossible and minimizing the amount of meat—especially\\nred meat—that is consumed. Many alternative therapies\\npromote vegetarianism as a method of detoxification.\\nThe aim of holistic medicine is to bring all areas of\\nan individual’s life, and most particularly the energy\\nflowing through the body , back into harmony . Ultimate-\\nly , of course, only the patient can be responsible for this,\\nfor no practitioner can make the necessary adjustments\\nto diet and lifestyle to achieve health. The practice of\\nholistic medicine does not rule out the practice of allo-\\npathic medicine; the two can complement each other.\\nA properly balanced holistic health regimen, which\\ntakes into consideration all aspects of human health and\\nincludes noninvasive and nonpharmaceutical healing\\nmethods, can often completely eradicate even acute\\nhealth conditions safely . If a patient is being treated with\\nallopathic medicine, holistic therapies may at least sup-\\nport the body during treatment and alleviate the symp-\\ntoms that often come with drug treatments and surgery .\\nIn addition, holistic therapies focus on the underlying\\nsource of the illness, to prevent recurrence.\\nHere are some of the major holistic therapies:\\n• herbal medicine\\n• homeopathy\\n• naturopathic medicine\\n• traditional Chinese medicine\\n• A yurvedic medicine\\n• nutritional therapies\\n• chiropractic\\n• stress reduction\\n• psychotherapy\\n• massage.\\nBecause holistic medicine aims to treat the whole per-\\nson, holistic practitioners sometimes may advise treatment\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 977\\nHolistic medicine\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 977'),\n",

A personal referral\\ncan sometimes be more reliable than a professional\\none. What do other professionals say about this thera-\\npist? What qualifications, board certification, or affilia-\\ntions does this practitioner have?\\n• How do you feel personally about this practitioner? Do\\nyou feel comfortable in his/her office and with his/her\\nstaff? Is your sense of well-being increased? Are you\\nkept waiting for appointments?\\n• Do you have confidence in this practitioner, and does\\nhe/she respect you as a person? Does he/she show an\\ninterest in your family , lifestyle, and diet? Are various\\ntreatment options explained to you?\\n• Is your personal dignity respected?\\n• Do you feel that this practitioner is sensitive to your\\nfeelings and fears regarding treatment?\\n• Is this practitioner a good advertisement for his/her\\nprofession? Signs of stress or ill health may mean that\\nyou would be better off choosing another practitioner.\\n• Do you feel that you are rushed into decisions, or do\\nyou feel that you are allowed time to make an informed\\nchoice regarding treatment?\\n• Are future health goals outlined for you? And do you\\nfeel that the practitioner is taking your progress seri-\\nously?\\n• Do you feel unconditionally accepted by this practi-\\ntioner?\\n• W ould you send your loved ones to this practitioner?\\nIf you answered yes to all the above, then you have\\nfound a suitable practitioner. The cost of treatment by a\\nholistic therapist varies widely depending on the level of\\nqualification and the discipline, so it is best to discuss\\nhow much treatment can be expected to cost with a prac-\\ntitioner before beginning a course of therapy . Some forms\\nof holistic treatment may be covered by health insurance.\\nPrecautions\\nMany people who try holistic therapies focus on one\\narea of their health only , often detoxification and nutrition.\\nHowever, practitioners stress that it is only when all areas of\\na person’s potential well-being are tackled that total health\\nand happiness can be achieved. They stress that the spiritual\\nand emotional health contribute just as much as physical\\nand mental health to a person’s overall state of well-being.\\nWhen seeking treatment from a holistic practitioner,\\nit is important to ensure that they are properly qualified.\\nCredentials and reputation should always be checked. In\\naddition, it is important that allopathic physicians and al-\\nternative physicians communicate with me another about\\na patient’s care.\\nSide effects\\nOne of the main advantages of holistic therapies is\\nthat they have few side effects when used correctly . If a\\nreputable practitioner is chosen and guidelines are ad-\\nhered to, the worst that typically happens is that when\\nlifestyle is changed, and fresh nutrients are provided, the\\nbody begins to eliminate toxins that may have accumu-\\nlated in the cells over a lifetime.\\nOften holistic therapy results in what is known in al-\\nternative medicine circles as a “healing crisis. ” This\\ncomes about when the cells eliminate poisons into the\\nblood stream all at the same time, throwing the system\\ninto a state of toxic overload until it can clear the “back-\\nlog. ” Symptoms such as nausea, headaches, or sensitivi-\\nties to noise and other stimulations may be experienced.\\nThe answer to most patients who are otherwise\\nhealthy patients is often just to lie quietly in a darkened\\nroom and take herbal teas. However, in the case of some-\\none who has a serious illness, such as arthritis, colitis, di-\\nabetes, or cancer, it is strongly advised that they seek the\\nhelp of a qualified practitioner. Therapists can help pa-\\ntients achieve detoxification in a way that causes the\\nleast stress to their bodies.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nTraditionally , holistic medicine, in all its different\\nforms, has been regarded with mistrust and skepticism\\non the part of the allopathic medical profession. This sit-\\nuation is gradually changing. As of the year 2004, many\\ninsurance companies will provide for some form of alter-\\nnative, or complementary treatment.\\nIn addition, many allopathic physicians, recognizing\\nthe role alternative medicine can play in overall health\\nand well being, are actually referring patients to reputable\\npractitioners, particularly chiropractors and relaxation\\ntherapists, for help with a varied range of complaints.\\nT raining & certification\\nHolistic or alternative medicine practitioners are usu-\\nally affiliated with an organization in their field.

Homeopathy is a treatment\\nto explore for acute and chronic illnesses, particularly if\\nthese are found in the early stages and where there is not\\nsevere damage. Homeopathy can be used to assist the\\nhealing process after surgery or chemotherapy .\\nDescription\\nA visit to a homeopath is usually a different experi-\\nence from a visit to a regular physician. Surveys have\\nshown that homeopathic doctors spend much more time\\nduring initial consultations than conventional doctors\\nspend. This is because a homeopath does a thorough\\ncase-taking to get a complete picture of a person’s gener-\\nal health and lifestyle, as well as particular symptoms, on\\nthe physical, mental and emotional levels. Some symp-\\ntoms can be so subtle that the patient is not always com-\\npletely aware of them, and the doctor must spend time\\ngetting to know the patient.\\nThe initial visit often includes a long questionnaire\\nabout a patient’s medical and family history , and then a\\nlong interview with the doctor, who prompts the patient\\nwith many questions. Sometimes a homeopathic doctor\\nwill use lab tests to establish a patient’s general level of\\nhealth. The initial interview usually lasts between one\\nand two hours.\\nThe purpose of homeopathy is the restoration of the\\nbody to homeostasis, or healthy balance, which is its nat-\\nural state. The symptoms of a disease are regarded as the\\nbody’s own defensive attempts to correct its imbalance,\\nrather than as enemies to be defeated. Because a home-\\nopath regards symptoms as positive evidence of the\\nbody’s inner intelligence, he or she will prescribe a rem-\\nedy designed to stimulate this internal curative process,\\nrather than suppress the symptoms.\\nIn homeopathy , the curative process extends beyond\\nthe relief of immediate symptoms of illness. Healing may\\ncome in many stages, as the practitioner treats layers of\\nsymptoms that are remnants of traumas or chronic disease\\nin the patient’s past. The stages are related to Hering’s\\nLaws of Cure, named for Constantine Hering, the father of\\nhomeopathy in America. Hering believed that healing\\nstarts from the deepest parts of the body to the extremities,\\nand from the upper parts of the body to the lower parts.\\nHering’s Laws also state that homeopaths should treat dis-\\nease symptoms in reverse chronological order, from the\\nmost recent to the oldest, restoring health in stages. Some-\\ntimes, the patient may feel worse before feeling better.\\nThis temporary worsening is called a healing crisis.\\nWhen prescribing a remedy , homeopaths will match\\na patient’s symptoms with the proper remedy in a reper-\\ntory or materia medica that has been compiled through-\\nout the history of homeopathy . Classical homeopaths\\nprescribe only one remedy at a time. However, it is be-\\ncoming more common, especially in Europe, to use com-\\nbination formulas of several remedies for the treatment\\nof some combinations of symptoms.\\nThe cost of homeopathic care can vary . The cost of\\nvisits will be comparable to conventional medicine, with\\ninitial visits ranging from $50 to $300. Non-M.D. home-\\nopaths can charge from $50 to $250. Follow-up visits are\\nless, at about $35 to $100. Homeopathic medicine is sig-\\nnificantly cheaper than pharmaceuticals, and most reme-\\ndies cost between $2 and $10. Some doctors provide\\nremedies without charge. Homeopaths rarely use lab\\ntests, which reduces the cost of treatment further. In gen-\\neral, homeopathy is much more economical than conven-\\ntional medicine. In 1991, the French government did a\\nstudy on the cost of homeopathic medicine, and found\\nthat it costs half as much to treat patients, considering all\\ntreatment costs involved.\\nWhen homeopaths are licensed professionals, most\\ninsurance companies will pay for their fees. Consumers\\nshould consult their insurance policies to determine indi-\\nvidual regulations. Insurance usually will not cover home-\\nopathic medicine, because it is sold over the counter.\\nPrecautions\\nAlthough homeopathic remedies sometimes use sub-\\nstances that are toxic, they are diluted and prescribed in\\nnon toxic doses. Remedies should be prescribed by a\\nhomeopathic practitioner. Those preparing to take homeo-\\npathic remedies should also avoid taking antidotes, which\\nare substances that homeopathic doctors believe cancel\\nthe effects of their remedies. These substances include al-\\ncohol, coffee, prescription drugs, peppermint (in tooth-\\npaste and mouthwash), camphor (in salves and lotions),\\nand very spicy foods. Homeopathic medicine should also\\nbe handled with care, and should not be touched with the\\nhands or fingers, which may contaminate it.\\nSide effects\\nA homeopathic aggravation sometimes occurs dur-\\ning initial treatment with homeopathic remedies. This\\nmeans that symptoms can temporarily worsen during the\\nprocess of healing. Although this is usually mild, the ag-\\ngravation can sometimes be severe. Homeopaths see ag-\\ngravation as a positive sign that the remedy is a good\\nmatch for the patient’s symptoms. The healing crisis,\\nwhich happens when the patient is undergoing treatment\\nfor layers of symptoms, may also cause the patient to\\nfeel worse before feeling better.

Aside from politics, part of the\\nreason for this hostility is that there are some aspects of\\nhomeopathy that have not been completely explained sci-\\nentifically . For instance, homeopaths have found that the\\nmore they dilute and succuss a remedy , the greater effect it\\nseems to have on the body . Some homeopathic remedies\\nare so diluted that not even a single molecule of the active\\nagent remains in a solution, yet it still works; studies have\\ndemonstrated this paradox, yet can’t explain it. Also,\\nhomeopathy puts an emphasis on analyzing symptoms and\\nthen applying remedies to these symptoms, rather than\\nworking by classifying diseases. Thus, some people with\\nthe same disease may require different homeopathic medi-\\ncines and treatments. Furthermore, conventional medicine\\nstrives to find out how medicines work in the body before\\nthey use them; homeopathy is less concerned with the intri-\\ncate biochemistry involved than with whether a remedy ul-\\ntimately works and heals holistically . For all these reasons,\\nconventional medicine claims that homeopathy is not sci-\\nentific, but homeopaths are quick to reply that homeopathy\\nhas been scientifically developed and studied for centuries,\\nwith much documentation and success.\\nThere continue to be many studies that affirm the ef-\\nfectiveness of homeopathic treatments. Among the most\\ncelebrated, the British Medical Journal in 1991 published\\na large analysis of homeopathic treatments that were\\ngiven over the course of 25 years.

Experimenting on himself\\nwith the anti-malarial drug quinine, Hahnemann noticed\\nthat large doses of the medicine actually caused malaria-\\nlike symptoms, while smaller doses cured the symptoms.\\nFrom this, he advanced his concept of Similia similibus\\ncurentur , or “let like be cured with like. ” Hahnemann\\nthen developed an extensive system of medicine based\\non this concept. He named it homeopathy , from the\\nGreek words homoios (the same) and pathos (suffering).\\nHomeopathic remedies are almost always made\\nfrom natural materials—plant, animal, or mineral sub-\\nstances—that have been treated to form mother tinctures\\nor nonsoluble powders. Liquid extracts are then poten-\\ntized, or increased in power, by a series of dilutions and\\nsuccussions, or shakings. It is thought that succussion is\\nnecessary to transfer the energy of the natural substance\\nto the solution. In addition, the potency of the remedy is\\nregarded as increasing with each dilution. After the tinc-\\nture has been diluted to the prescribed potency , the re-\\nsulting solution is added to a bottle of sucrose/lactose\\ntablets, which are stored in a cool, dark place. If the rem-\\nedy is not soluble in water, it is ground to a fine powder\\nand triturated with powdered lactose to achieve the de-\\nsired potency .\\nProponents of homeopathy over the years have in-\\ncluded Louisa May Alcott, Charles Dickens, Benjamin\\nDisraeli, Johann W olfgang Goethe, Nathaniel Hawthorne,\\nWilliam James, Henry W adsworth Longfellow , Pope Pius\\nX, John D. Rockefeller, Harriet Beecher Stowe, William\\nThackeray , Daniel W ebster, and W . B. Y eats. England’s\\nroyal family has employed homeopathic practitioners\\nsince the 1830s.\\nBenefits\\nHomeopathic physicians seek to cure their patients\\non physical, mental, and emotional levels, and each\\ntreatment is tailored to a patient’s individual needs.\\nHomeopathy is generally a safe treatment, as it uses\\nmedicines in extremely diluted quantities, and there are\\nusually minimal side effects. Its nontoxicity makes it a\\ngood choice for the treatment of children. Another bene-\\nfit of homeopathy is the cost of treatments; homeopathic\\nremedies are inexpensive, often a fraction of the cost of\\nconventional drugs.\\nAcute homeopathic prescribing is thought to benefit\\na wide range of ailments.

Homeopathy may be further employed in\\ntreating injuries including black eyes, burns , bruises,\\nconcussions, cuts, damaged tendons and ligaments, dis-\\nlocations, fractures , herniated discs, nosebleeds , punc-\\nture wounds, sprains, and strains.\\nDescription\\nHomeopathic prescribing differs in general from al-\\nlopathic medicine in its tailoring of remedies to the pa-\\ntient’s overall personality type and totality of symptoms,\\nrather than to the disease. Whereas a conventional physi-\\ncian would prescribe the same medication or treatment\\nregimen to all patients with the common cold, for exam-\\nple, a homeopathic practitioner would ask detailed ques-\\ntions about each patient’s symptoms and the modalities,\\nor factors, that make them better or worse. As a result,\\nthe homeopath might prescribe six different remedies for\\nsix different patients with the same illness. In acute pre-\\nscribing homeopathy , consultations are more brief com-\\npared to constitutional homeopathic prescribing. A typi-\\ncal patient might spend just 10–15 minutes with the\\npractitioner, compared to more than an hour for constitu-\\ntional prescribing.\\nHomeopathic classification of symptoms\\nHomeopathic practitioners use the word symptom in\\na more inclusive fashion than traditional medicine. In\\nhomeopathy , symptoms include any change that the pa-\\ntient experiences during the illness, including changes in\\nemotional or mental patterns.\\nHomeopaths classify symptoms according to a hier-\\narchy of four categories for purposes of acute prescribing:\\n• Peculiar symptoms. These are symptoms unique to the\\nindividual that do not occur in most persons with the\\nacute disease. Homeopaths make note of peculiar\\nsymptoms because they often help to determine the\\nremedy .\\n• Mental and emotional symptoms. These are important\\ngeneral symptoms that inform the homeopath about the\\npatient’s total experience of the disorder.\\n• Other general symptoms. These are physical symptoms\\nfelt throughout the patient’s body , such as tiredness,\\nchanges in appetite, or restlessness.\\n• Particular symptoms. Particular symptoms are local-\\nized in the body; they include such symptoms as nau-\\nsea, skin rashes, headache, etc.\\nDuring homeopathic case-taking, the practitioner\\nwill evaluate the intensity of the patient’s symptoms, as-\\nsess their depth within the patient’s body , note any pecu-\\nliar symptoms, evaluate the modalities of each symptom,\\nand make a list of key symptoms to guide the selection\\nof the proper medicine.\\nHomeopathic remedies\\nThere are several hundred homeopathic remedies.\\nHomeopathic medicines are usually formulated from di-\\nluted or triturated natural substances, including plants,\\nminerals, or even venom from snakes or stinging insects.\\nSome remedies may be given in a spray , ointment, or\\ncream, but the most common forms of administration are\\nliquid dilutions and two sizes of pellets, or cylindrical\\ntablets (for triturated remedies). A dose consists of one\\ndrop of liquid; 10–20 small pellets; or 1–3 large pellets.\\nSince the remedies are so dilute, the exact size of the dose\\nis not of primary importance. The frequency of dosing is\\nconsidered critical, however; patients are advised not to\\ntake further doses until the first has completed its effect.\\nHomeopathic remedies can be kept indefinitely with\\nproper handling. Proper handling includes storing the\\nremedies in the original bottles and discarding them if\\nthey become contaminated by sunlight or other intense\\nlight; temperatures over 100°F (37.8°C); vapors from\\ncamphor, mothballs, or perfume; or from other homeo-\\npathic remedies being opened in the same room at the\\nsame time.\\nPreparations\\nCase-taking\\nThe first step in acute prescribing is a lengthy inter-\\nview with the patient, known as case-taking. In addition\\nto noting the character, location, and severity of the pa-\\ntient’s symptoms, the homeopath will ask about their\\nmodalities. The modalities are the circumstances or fac-\\ntors (e.g., weather, time of day , body position, behavior\\nor activity , etc.) that make the symptoms either better or\\nworse. Case-taking can be done by the patient or a fami-\\nly member as well as by a homeopath.\\nSelection and administration of a remedy\\nThe choice of a specific remedy is guided by the pa-\\ntient’s total symptom profile rather than by the illness.\\nHomeopathic remedies are prescribed according to the\\nlaw of similars, which holds that a substance that pro-\\nduces specific symptoms in healthy people cures those\\nsymptoms in sick people when given in highly diluted\\nforms.

Unlike\\nacute homeopathic prescribing, constitutional prescrib-\\ning refers to the selection and administration of homeo-\\npathic preparations over a period of time for treatment\\nrelated to what practitioners call miasmic disorders,\\nthose caused by an inherited predisposition to a disease.\\nThe term miasm comes from a Greek word meaning\\nstain or pollution. As in acute prescribing, constitutional\\nprescribing is holistic in that it is intended to treat the pa-\\ntient on the emotional and spiritual levels of his or her\\nbeing as well as the physical. Constitutional prescribing\\nis also aimed at eventual cure of the patient, not just sup-\\npression or relief of immediate symptoms.\\nOrigins\\nHomeopathy was developed during the 1790s by\\nSamuel Hahnemann, a German physician. Experiment-\\ning on himself with the anti-malarial drug quinine, Hah-\\nnemann noticed that large doses of the medicine actually\\ncaused malaria-like symptoms, while smaller doses\\ncured the symptoms. From this, he advanced his concept\\nof Similia similibus curentur , or “let like be cured with\\nlike. ” Hahnemann then developed an extensive system of\\nmedicine based on this concept. He named it homeopa-\\nthy , from the Greek words homoios (the same) and\\npathos (suffering).\\nThere are several hundred homeopathic remedies.\\nThey are almost always made from natural materials—\\nplant, animal, or mineral substances—that have been\\ntreated to form mother tinctures or nonsoluble powders.\\nLiquid extracts are then potentized, or increased in\\npower, by a series of dilutions and succussions, or shak-\\nings. It is thought that succussion is necessary to transfer\\nthe energy of the natural substance to the solution. In ad-\\ndition, the potency of the remedy is regarded as increas-\\ning with each dilution. After the tincture has been diluted\\nto the prescribed potency , the resulting solution is added\\nto a bottle of sucrose/lactose tablets, which are stored in\\na cool, dark place. If the remedy is not soluble in water,\\nit is ground to a fine powder and triturated with pow-\\ndered lactose to achieve the desired potency .\\nProponents of homeopathy over the years have in-\\ncluded Louisa May Alcott, Charles Dickens, Benjamin\\nDisraeli, Johann W olfgang von Goethe, Nathaniel\\nHawthorne, William James, Henry W adsworth Longfel-\\nlow , Pope Pius X, John D. Rockefeller, Harriet Beecher\\nStowe, William Thackeray , Daniel W ebster, and W . B.\\nY eats. England’s royal family has employed homeopath-\\nic practitioners since the 1830s.\\nBenefits\\nHomeopathic physicians seek to cure their patients\\non physical, mental, and emotional levels, and each\\ntreatment is tailored to a patient’s individual needs.\\nHomeopathy is generally a safe treatment, as it uses\\nmedicines in extremely diluted quantities, and there are\\nusually minimal side effects. Its nontoxicity makes some\\nconsider it a good choice for the treatment of children.\\nAnother benefit of homeopathy is the cost of treatments;\\nhomeopathic remedies are inexpensive, often a fraction\\nof the cost of conventional drugs.\\nClassical homeopathy has been used to treat a wide\\nrange of diseases and conditions, most of which tend to\\nbe long-term. These include: alcoholism, allergies, anxi-\\nety, arthritis, asthma , bladder conditions, chronic fa-\\ntigue syndrome , depression , drug dependencies, gas-\\ntrointestinal problems, Gulf W ar sickness, headache ,\\nhearing problems, herpes, hypersensitivity , immune dis-\\norders, insomnia, joint problems, kidney conditions, liver\\nproblems, Lyme disease, lower back problems, malaria,\\nmenopause , menstrual problems, migraine, multiple\\nsclerosis , paralysis, phobias , shingles , sinus problems,\\nskin disorders, repetitive stress injury , rheumatism, verti-\\ngo, vision problems, and yeast infections.\\nDescription\\nConstitutional prescribing is based on the patient’s\\nsymptom profile and specific aspects of homeopathic\\ntheory .\\nHomeopathic classification of symptoms\\nHomeopathic practitioners use the word symptom in\\na more inclusive fashion than traditional medicine. In\\nhomeopathy , symptoms include any change that the pa-\\ntient experiences during the illness, including changes in\\nemotional or mental patterns.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 989\\nHomeopathy , constitutional prescribing\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 989'),\n",

These are symptoms unique to the\\nindividual that do not occur in most persons. Home-\\nopaths make note of peculiar symptoms because they\\noften help to determine the remedy .\\n• Mental and emotional symptoms. These are important\\ngeneral symptoms that inform the homeopath about the\\npatient’s total experience of the disorder.\\n• Other general symptoms. These are physical symptoms\\nfelt throughout the patient’s body , such as tiredness,\\nchanges in appetite, or restlessness.\\n• Particular symptoms. Particular symptoms are local-\\nized in the body; they include such symptoms as nau-\\nsea, skin rashes, or headaches.\\nMiasms\\nHomeopaths regard the patient’s symptom profile as\\na systemic manifestation of an underlying chronic disor-\\nder called a miasm. Miasms are serious disturbances of\\nwhat homeopaths call the patient’s vital force that are in-\\nherited from parents at the time of conception. Hahne-\\nmann believed that the parents’ basic lifestyle, their emo-\\ntional condition and habitual diet, and even the atmos-\\npheric conditions at the time of conception would affect\\nthe number and severity of miasms passed on to the child.\\nHahnemann himself distinguished three miasms: the\\npsoric, which he considered the most universal source of\\nchronic disease in humans; the syphilitic; and the sycotic,\\nwhich he attributed to gonorrhea . Later homeopaths\\nidentified two additional miasms, the cancernic and the\\ntuberculinic. The remaining major source of miasms is al-\\nlopathic medicine. It is thought that specific allopathic\\ntreatments—particularly smallpox vaccinations, cortisone\\npreparations, major tranquilizers, and antibiotics—can\\nproduce additional layers of miasms in the patient’s con-\\nstitution. Constitutional prescribing evaluates the per-\\nson’s current state or miasmic picture, and selects a reme-\\ndy intended to correct or balance that state. The home-\\nopath may prescribe a different remedy for each miasmic\\nlayer over time, but gives only one remedy at a time di-\\nrected at the person’s current state. The basic principle\\ngoverning the prescription of each successive remedy is\\nthe law of similars, or “like cures like. ”\\nHering’s laws of cure\\nThe homeopathic laws of cure were outlined by Con-\\nstantine Hering, a student of Hahnemann who came to the\\nUnited States in the 1830s. Hering enunciated three laws\\nor principles of the patterns of healing that are used by\\nhomeopaths to evaluate the effectiveness of specific reme-\\ndies and the overall progress of constitutional prescribing:\\n• Healing progresses from the deepest parts of the organ-\\nism to the external parts. Homeopaths consider the per-\\nson’s mental and emotional dimensions, together with\\nthe brain, heart, and other vital organs, as a person’s\\ndeepest parts. The skin, hands, and feet are considered\\nthe external parts.\\n• Symptoms appear or disappear in the reverse of their\\nchronological order of appearance. In terms of consti-\\ntutional treatment, this law means that miasms acquired\\nlater in life will resolve before earlier ones.\\n• Healing proceeds from the upper to the lower parts of\\nthe body .\\nHealing crises\\nHomeopaths use Hering’s laws to explain the appear-\\nance of so-called healing crises, or aggravations, in the\\ncourse of homeopathic treatment. It is not unusual for pa-\\ntients to experience temporary worsening of certain symp-\\ntoms after taking their first doses of homeopathic treat-\\nment. For example, a person might notice that arthritic\\npains in the shoulders are better but that the hands feel\\nworse. Hering’s third law would indicate that the remedy is\\nworking because the symptoms are moving downward in\\nthe body . In constitutional prescribing, a remedy that re-\\nmoves one of the patient’s miasmic layers will then allow\\nthe symptoms of an older miasm to emerge. Thus the pa-\\ntient may find that a physical disease is followed by a dif-\\nferent set of physical problems or by emotional symptoms.\\nPreparations\\nThe most important aspects of preparation for con-\\nstitutional prescribing are the taking of a complete pa-\\ntient history and careful patient education.\\nCase-taking\\nHomeopathic case-taking for constitutional pre-\\nscribing is similar to that for acute prescribing, but more\\nin-depth. The initial interview generally takes one to two\\nhours. The practitioner is concerned with recording the\\ntotality of the patient’s symptoms and the modalities that\\ninfluence their severity . Also included are general char-\\nacteristics about the patient and his or her lifestyle choic-\\nes. For example, a practitioner might ask the patient if he\\nor she likes being outside or is generally hot or cold.\\nThere is also an emphasis on the patient’s lifetime med-\\nical history , particularly records of allopathic treatments.\\nPatient education\\nHomeopaths regard patients as equal partners in the\\nprocess of recovery .

Patient education is\\nespecially important in constitutional prescribing in\\norder to emphasize the need for patience with the slow-\\nness of results and length of treatment, and to minimize\\nthe possibility of self-treatment with allopathic drugs if\\nthe patient has a healing crisis.\\nHomeopathic remedies\\nIn constitutional prescribing, one dose of the select-\\ned remedy is given. Patients then wait two to six weeks\\nbefore following up with the homeopath, while the body\\nbegins the healing process. At the follow-up visit, the\\nremedy may be repeated, or a different remedy pre-\\nscribed. The preparation, selection, administration, and\\nstorage of remedies for constitutional prescribing are the\\nsame as for acute prescribing. These procedures are de-\\nscribed more fully in the article on acute prescribing.\\nPrecautions\\nConstitutional homeopathic prescribing is not ap-\\npropriate for diseases or health crises requiring emer-\\ngency treatment, whether medical, surgical, or psychi-\\natric. In addition, constitutional prescribing should not\\nbe self-administered. Although home treatment kits of\\nhomeopathic remedies are available for acute self-limit-\\ned disorders, the knowledge of homeopathic theory and\\npractice required for constitutional evaluation is beyond\\nthe scope of most patients.\\nPatients are instructed to avoid touching homeopath-\\nic medicines with their fingers. The dose can be poured\\nonto a piece of white paper or the bottle’s cap and tipped\\ndirectly into the mouth. Homeopathic remedies are not\\ntaken with water; patients should not eat or drink any-\\nthing for 15–20 minutes before or after taking the dose.\\nHomeopathic remedies may lose their potency if\\nused at the same time as other products. Some homeo-\\npathic practitioners recommend the avoidance of mint\\nand mentholated products (toothpastes, candies, chewing\\ngum, mouth rinses), as well as camphor and camphorat-\\ned products (including eucalyptus and Tiger Balm),\\npatchouli and other essential oils, moth balls, strong per-\\nfumes, aftershaves, scented soaps, stress, x rays, coffee,\\nnicotine, recreational drugs ( marijuana ) and certain\\ntherapeutic drugs (most notably cortisone and pred-\\nnisone) during treatment. Patients are also advised to\\navoid electric blankets and dental work, as these are\\nthought to adversely affect homeopathic therapy . Home-\\nopathic remedies should never be placed near magnets.\\nSide effects\\nHomeopathic medicines are so diluted that some-\\ntimes no trace of the original substance can be detected.\\nThese medicines are therefore considered non-toxic and\\ngenerally free of harmful side effects. The primary risks\\nto the patient from constitutional homeopathic treatment\\nare the symptoms of the healing crisis and individual re-\\nactions to homeopathic medicine. The complexity of\\nconstitutional prescribing requires homeopaths to have\\ndetailed knowledge of the materia medica and the reper-\\ntories, and to take careful and extensive case notes.\\nAn intensified healing response may occur as treat-\\nment begins, which causes symptoms to worsen, but the\\nphenomenon is temporary . In some patients, old symptoms\\nmay re-appear from past conditions from which recovery\\nwas not complete. Such phenomena are taken as positive\\nindications that the healing process has commenced.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nAs Samuel Hahnemann’s healing system grew in\\npopularity during the 1800s, it quickly attracted vehe-\\nment opposition from the medical and apothecary profes-\\nsions. Since the early 1900s, when the American Medical\\nAssociation and pharmacists waged a battle against it,\\nhomeopathy has been neglected and sometimes ridiculed\\nby mainstream medicine. Aside from politics, part of the\\nreason for this oppostion is that there are some aspects of\\nhomeopathy which have not been completely explained\\nscientifically . For instance, homeopaths have found that\\nthe more they dilute and succuss a remedy , the greater ef-\\nfect it seems to have on the body . Some homeopathic\\nremedies are so diluted that not even a single molecule of\\nthe active agent remains in a solution, yet homeopaths\\nmaintain that it still works. Also, homeopathy puts an em-\\nphasis on analyzing symptoms and then applying reme-\\ndies to these symptoms, rather than working by classify-\\ning diseases. Thus some people with the same disease\\nmay require different homeopathic medicines and treat-\\nments. Furthermore, conventional medicine strives to find\\nout how medicines work in the body before they use\\nthem; homeopathy is less concerned with the intricate\\nbiochemistry involved than with whether a remedy ulti-\\nmately works and heals holistically . For all these reasons,\\nconventional medicine claims that homeopathy is not sci-\\nentific, while homeopaths are quick to reply that home-\\nopathy has been scientifically developed and studied for\\ncenturies, with much documentation and success.\\nThere continue to be many studies on the effective-\\nness of homeopathic treatments. Among the most cele-\\nbrated, the British Medical Journal in 1991 published a\\nlarge analysis of homeopathic treatments that were given\\nover the course of 25 years. This project involved more\\nthan 100 studies of patients with problems ranging from\\nvascular diseases, respiratory problems, infections, stom-\\nach problems, allergies, recovery from surgeries, arthri-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 991\\nHomeopathy , constitutional prescribing\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 991'),\n",

There are over 300 species of honeysuckle in\\nthe Caprifoliaceae family , found from Asia to North\\nAmerica. The shrub reaches heights of 20–30 ft (6–9 m),\\nwith thin, hairy branches. It has ovoid leaves that range\\n1.2–3.2 in (3–8 cm) long by 0.6–1.6 in (1.5–4.0 cm)\\nwide. The plant flowers in late spring or early summer,\\ndepending on the species. Japanese honeysuckle\\n(Lonicera japonica ) blooms in the spring from April to\\nMay , with fragrant white flowers touched with a shade of\\npurple that fade to yellow as they mature. The species of\\nhoneysuckle that is found in North America, the United\\nKingdom, and western Asia, Lonicera caprifolium, flow-\\ners in June. Generally , honeysuckle flowers are 1.2–1.6 in\\n(3–4) cm long, with an inner tube of approximately the\\nsame length. All varieties of honeysuckle are famous for\\nthis tube, which is extracted and sucked for its sweet nec-\\ntar. The shrub also produces a black berry . Despite the\\nsweetness of its fragrance and nectar, the medicinal parts\\nof the plant are bitter, due to the saponin in its stem, the\\n8% tannin in the leaves and the 1% insitol in its flowers.\\nGeneral use\\nJapanese honeysuckle (L. japonica, also called Japan-\\nese jin yin hua, which means gold and silver flower) and\\ncommon honeysuckle (L. caprifolium, also called Italian\\nhoneysuckle, Dutch honeysuckle, and woodbine) are both\\nwidely used for their medicinal qualities. Although the\\nChinese most commonly use the bud of the flower in their\\nmedical practice, in other countries it is mostly the flowers\\nand leaves that are used for their healing properties. Japan-\\nese honeysuckle works well as a detoxifier, and is best\\nused for acute infections and inflammations. As an alter-\\native, which cleanses and purifies the blood, and an an-\\ntipyretic, which reduces fever with its cooling properties,\\nJapanese honeysuckle is best used for such ailments as\\nsore throats, swollen eyes, headaches, etc.\\nAcute infections and inflammations\\nJapanese honeysuckle is most useful in treating acute\\nillnesses, infections and inflammations. At the onset of a\\ncold, honeysuckle should be taken in combination with\\nchrysanthemum flowers. Several popular Chinese formu-\\nlas, such as yin chaio and ganmaoling, contain this herbal\\ncombination. Because it is a natural antibiotic, honey-\\nsuckle can also be used to treat infections caused by\\nstaphylococcal or streptococcal bacteria. Honeysuckle\\nshould be used for acute conditions, and is not meant to\\nbe used in the treatment of chronic illnesses.\\nSkin infections\\nHoneysuckle works well against internal infections,\\nand it can also be used externally for skin irritation and\\ninfections. Honeysuckle has been found useful in allevi-\\nating rashes ranging from skin diseases to poison oak.\\nFor these types of skin ailments, honeysuckle is best\\nused as a poultice.

They are used\\nin three ways: as a sedative, to aid digestion, and as an\\nantibiotic.\\nHops’ best known medicinal function is as a mild\\nsedative and sleep aid. For centuries pillows filled with\\nhops have been prescribed for people who have difficulty\\nfalling asleep. Hops extracts taken orally are also said to\\npromote sleep. Hops are chemically complex and con-\\ntain many different compounds. Scientists have separat-\\ned out several components that are sedative in nature, al-\\nthough it is not clear whether hops contain enough of\\nthese compounds to actually make a person sleepy . Stud-\\nies are ongoing, but the German Federal Health\\nAgency’s Commission E, established in 1978 to inde-\\npendently review and evaluate scientific literature and\\ncase studies pertaining to herb and plant medications,\\nhas approved hops for sleep problems, restlessness, and\\nanxiety . Hops belongs to the same family of herbs as\\nmarijuana , and some people claim it produces a mild,\\nrelaxed, euphoric feeling when smoked. There is no sci-\\nentific evidence for this claim.\\nThe second major use of hops is as an aid to diges-\\ntion. It has been used for centuries in both traditional\\nChinese medicine and Native American healing to stim-\\nulate the appetite, ease digestion, and aid in relieving\\ncolic. It is believed that hops stimulates the secretions of\\nthe stomach.\\nThe German E Commission has also concluded that\\nhops may act as a digestive aid. Scientists have isolated\\nanother extract from the plant that in the laboratory in-\\nhibits spasms in the digestive tract and other smooth mus-\\ncle. Follow-up studies in people have not yet been done.\\nChinese healers use hops to treat tuberculosis and\\nas an antibiotic. T est-tube studies show that the bitter\\nacids in hops inhibit the growth of certain bacteria and\\nfungi, including the common bacteria Staphylococcis au-\\nreus (responsible for staph infections) and Bacillus sub-\\ntilis; but do not inhibit Escherichia coli, a bacterium that\\ncauses digestive upsets. This antibacterial action may ac-\\ncount for the preservative effect of hops in brewed beer.\\nA 1999 study also showed that some compounds isolated\\nfrom hops were effective in test-tube studies in reducing\\nthe proliferation of certain types of human breast and\\novarian cancer cells. As of 2002, hops extract is being\\nstudied as a possible cancer chemopreventive.\\nThere has been much debate in the healing commu-\\nnity about whether hops contain a compound related to\\nor easily converted into estrogen, the main female hor-\\nmone. Some herbalists believe that the presence of an es-\\ntrogenic compound accounts for the dampening of male\\nsexual arousal and the control of sexual nervous tension\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHallowell, Michael.

In North America, several\\nNative American tribes independently discovered the heal-\\ning properties of hops and used them as a sedative and\\nsleep aid, to relieve toothache, and to improve digestion.\\nBy the end of the 1800s, hops were being routinely used\\nin mainstream medicine in the United States as a sedative\\nand digestive tonic.

The com-\\nmon name horehound comes from the Old English\\nwords har and hune, meaning downy plant. This descrip-\\ntive name refers to the white hairs that give this herb its\\ndistinctive hoary appearance. Another suggested deriva-\\ntion is from the name of the Egyptian god of sky and\\nlight, Horus. Horehound is one of the oldest known\\ncough remedies. It was one of the herbs in the medicine\\nchests of the Egyptian pharaohs. In Roman times, Cae-\\nsar’s antidote for poison included horehound. The gener-\\nic name is believed to be derived from the Hebrew word\\nmarrob , meaning bitter juice. Horehound is one of the\\nbitter herbs used in the Jewish Passover rites. Through-\\nout its long history , white horehound has been valued not\\nonly as a folk remedy for coughs and congested lungs,\\nbut also as a magic herb for protection against the spells\\nattributed to witches.\\nBlack horehound ( Ballota nigra ), also known as\\nblack stinking horehound, is the smelly relative of white\\nhorehound.

Another possibility may be\\nthat it is named for the small horseshoe-like markings\\nthat are present on the branches of the horse chestnut tree.\\nHorse chestnut trees grow in nearly any soil but\\nseem to prefer a sandy loam. They grow very rapidly\\ninto tall straight trees that can reach heights of over 100\\nft (approximately 30 m) tall, with widely spreading\\nbranches. The bark is grayish-green or grayish-brown in\\ncolor, and the tree limbs are thick and have corky , elon-\\ngated, wart-like eruptions that appear from a distance\\nlike ribbing. The interior of horse chestnut bark is pink-\\nish-brown, with fine lines running its length. It is odor-\\nless and its taste is very bitter and astringent.\\nThe characteristic horseshoe markings found on\\nthe branches are actually the scars from where leaves\\npreviously grew . Horse chestnut wood is seldom if ever\\nused for lumber due to its soft and spongy character.\\nLarge leaf and flower buds are clearly visible even dur-\\ning winter months but are encased in a scaly , resinous\\nprotective covering that prevents damage from frost or\\ndamp. This thick sticky coating melts with the begin-\\nning of warm weather in spring, and flowers and leaves\\nappear with remarkable rapidity , usually within three to\\nfour weeks.\\nThe leaves are dark green, rough in texture, and\\nlarge, with minutely serrated edges. Horse chestnut\\nleaves can be nearly 1 ft (0.3 m) in length. They some-\\nwhat resemble a hand with five to nine leaf sections\\nemerging from a palm-like base to form the finger-like\\nprojections. European horse chestnuts produce clusters\\nof white flowers with a pale scarlet tinge at the throat or\\nyellow mottling. American horse chestnut flowers can\\nbe white, pale pink, or yellow , depending upon the\\nspecies. All types of horse chestnut trees, with their\\ngraceful wide limbs and showy flowers, are grown for\\ntheir ornamental beauty .\\nThe fruit of the horse chestnut is a dark brown\\nsmooth-surfaced nut approximately 2 in (5 cm) in di-\\nameter. It has a polished appearance except for the\\nrounded dull tan-colored scar on the side that was at-\\ntached to the seed vessel. Horse chestnuts are encased\\nin a light green spine-covered coating that divides into\\nthree parts and drops away prior to the nut dropping\\nfrom the tree. Horse chestnut nuts contain mostly car-\\nbohydrates which are generally indigestible until\\nboiled. They also contain saponins, tannin, flavones,\\ntwo glycosides, aesculin and fraxin, some crude pro-\\ntein, a fatty oil, ash and water.\\nHorse chestnuts native to North America are called\\nbuckeyes because of their large seeds which resembling\\nthe eye of a buck, or male deer.\\nAmerican horse chestnuts are divided into four\\ntypes:\\n• Ohio buckeye, or Aesculus glabra , is a medium-sized\\ntree which grows from the southern United States to\\nthe prairies of western Canada. It is the state tree of\\nOhio, hence the state’s nickname of the Buckeye State.\\n• Y ellow buckeye,Aesculus octandra , or Aesculus flava ,\\nis a tree which grows to heights of 40 ft (12 m) or\\nmore. It is fairly common across the central portion of\\nthe United States. Its leaves are somewhat smoother\\nthan those of other horse chestnuts.\\n• Red buckeye, or Aesculus pavia, is a shrub or small tree\\nthat generally is found in the southern United States. In\\nearly summer it develops brilliantly scarlet flowers in\\nlarge clusters, and has dense foliage. The tree species\\nof red buckeye grows to heights of between 15–20 ft\\n(5–7 m) tall.\\n• California buckeye, or Aesculus californica , is a horse\\nchestnut tree found all along the Pacific coast.\\nGeneral use\\nHorse chestnuts have been used as fodder for feed-\\ning farm animals, and some Native American peoples\\nhave included them in their diet. However, the outer cov-\\nering of the horse chestnut nut is toxic, and the nut itself\\nhas to be boiled prior to being eaten safely . Its wood,\\nwhich is too soft for furniture-making or construction, is\\nused in building crates and other packing cases.\\nBoth the bark and the fruit from horse chestnut trees\\nare used medicinally to strengthen and tone the circula-\\ntory system, especially the venous system. It is used both\\ninternally and externally to treat varicose veins,\\nphlebitis, and hemorrhoids. Horse chestnut preparations\\nare particularly effective in treating varicose ulcers. Due\\nto its ability to improve circulation, it is also helpful for\\nthe relief of leg cramps. Its bark also has narcotic and\\nfever-reducing properties. A compound known as aescin,\\nwhich is present in the horse chestnut fruit, is now often\\nadded to external creams and preparations used for the\\ntreatment of varicose veins, varicose ulcers, bruises, and\\nsports injuries.\\nHorse chestnut preparations using the seed, bark,\\ntwigs, and leaves are all utilized in traditional Chinese\\nmedicine. Chinese herbalists consider horse chestnut to\\nbe a part of treatment not only for circulatory problems,\\nbut use it as an astringent, as a diuretic, for reduction of\\nedema or swelling, to reduce inflammation, as an expec-\\ntorant in respiratory problems, and to fight viruses.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21000\\nHorse chestnut\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1000'),\n",

Horse-\\ntail grows in temperate northern hemisphere areas of\\nAsia, Europe, North America, and North Africa. It flour-\\nishes where it can root in water or clay soil.\\nHorsetail is a derivative of larger plants that grew\\n270 million years ago during the carboniferous period. It\\nbelongs to the Equisetaceae family and is a relative of\\nthe fern.\\nThere are over 20 species of horsetail. The species\\nmost commonly used medicinally is field horsetail (Equi-\\nsetum arvense ). E. arvense grows up to 1.5 ft (0.5 m) in\\ncorn fields and wet meadows. W ood horsetail ( E. syl-\\nvaticum) grows in copses and on hedgebanks, usually to a\\nheight of 1-2 ft (0.3-0.6 m). This species is used as food\\nfor horses in parts of Sweden. River horsetail ( E. maxi-\\nmum) is the largest of the European species of horsetail.\\nFound in bogs, ditches, and on banks of rivers and ponds,\\nE. maximum grows to a height of 3-6 ft (1-2 m).\\nHorsetail has no leaves or flowers and grows in two\\nstages. The first stage occurs during the early spring. At\\nthis time, a fertile hollow stem appears that resembles as-\\nparagus. After these stems have withered and died, the\\nsecond stage begins. During this stage, which occurs\\nduring the summer months, thin green barren stems\\nbranch out from the plant. It is during this stage that\\nhorsetail is gathered for medicinal use.\\nHorsetail was named for its bristly appearance. The\\ngenus name Equisetum is derived from the Latin words\\nequus , meaning horse, and seta , meaning bristle. Other\\nnames for horsetail include shave-grass, bottle-brush,\\nand paddock-pipes.\\nHorsetail contains silicon, potassium , aluminum,\\nmanganese, saponins, phytosterols, phenolic acids, cafe-\\nic acids, alkaloids, and tannins. Fifteen types of\\nbioflavonoids are also present. These bioflavonoids are\\nbelieved to be responsible for horsetail’s strong diuretic\\naction. The high silicon content of the herb strengthens\\nconnective tissue, ligaments, bones, hair, and fingernails.\\nOrigins\\nThe medicinal use of horsetail dates back to ancient\\nRoman and Greek times. The Greeks used horsetail as a\\nwound healer, a diuretic, and an agent to stop bleeding.\\nNicholas Culpeper, a popular seventeenth-century\\nherbalist, wrote of horsetail’s beneficial properties in\\nstopping bleeding, and treating ulcers, kidney stones ,\\nwounds, and skin inflammation.

Shoots of a larger species of horsetail\\nwere sometimes eaten by the poorer classes, although\\nthe food lacked taste and wasn’t very nutritious.\\nGeneral use\\nHerbalists still use horsetail to treat a variety of kid-\\nney and bladder problems. Horsetail has properties that\\nhelp bladder and kidney tissue. Its tonifyng effects help\\nto reduce inflammation in such conditions as kidney\\nstones, bladder and kidney infections , weak bladder,\\nweak kidney , and urinary incontinence.\\nThe German Commission E has approved horsetail as\\nan effective treatment for kidney and bladder inflamma-\\ntions, edema, urinary tract infections, and bacterial infec-\\ntions. It is also used as a component in diuretic drugs.\\nSilica and horsetail\\nHorsetail is rich in minerals, particularly silica de-\\nposited in its stems. Silica helps to promote the body’s\\nabsorption of calcium, an important component in tissue\\nrepair and bone and cartilage formation. Horsetail’s sili-\\nca and silicic acid content ranges from 5-8%, making it a\\ngood source for strengthening weak connective tissues,\\nand healing bones, fractures, and torn ligaments. Horse-\\ntail is also used to treat arthritis and osteoporosis, as the\\nsilicon in horsetail may replace lost silicon in the affect-\\ned bones.\\nHorsetail may be a possible remedy for senility . Se-\\nnility often occurs when there is more aluminum in the\\nblood than silicon. One theory suggests that when the\\nsilicon and aluminum levels are balanced, the symptoms\\nof senility will disappear.\\nWound healer\\nHorsetail’s ability to stop blood flow has made it\\nuseful in treating nosebleeds , internal bleeding, heavy\\nmenstrual bleeding, bleeding hemorrhoids , and bleed-\\ning wounds. Often a compress made from fresh horsetail\\njuice is placed on the wound to stop the flow of blood.\\nThe healing effect may be strongest when horsetail is\\ntaken both internally and externally .\\nOther uses\\nHorsetail is also used to remedy brittle nails, bleed-\\ning wounds, hair loss, cystic ulcers, rheumatoid arthri-\\ntis, gout, gonorrhea, digestive disturbances, bronchitis ,\\nlung disorders, tuberculosis, poor teeth and gums, vari-\\ncose veins, and fallen arches. Skin ailments such as sties,\\nrashes, itchy eczema, or eye inflammation may be treat-\\ned with an external compress made from horsetail tea.\\nry , horsetail was also used to treat gonorrhea, prostatitis,\\nand urinary incontinence.\\nThe North American native peoples used horsetail to\\ntreat a number of kidney and bladder ailments. The\\nCherokee used horsetail to aid the kidneys. Chippewa\\nnatives made a decoction out of horsetail stems and used\\nit to treat painful or difficult urination.

Ranging from mild to se-\\nvere in intensity , they may be preceded by an “aura-like”\\nexperience, and may be followed by a subsequent feeling\\nof chill. With natural age-related menopause, hot flashes\\nmay begin as early as two years prior to the cessation of\\nmenses and continue as long as five or more years after-\\nward. Statistically , the average experience is approxi-\\nmately four years of hot flashes of varying intensities.\\nDescription\\nApproximately 20% of women without breast can-\\ncer and 50–75% of women taking tamoxifen subsequent\\nto breast cancer will reportedly seek a doctor’s advice for\\nthe management of hot flashes. For women without breast\\ncancer, this seems to be a conservative estimate, given that\\nanother source notes that as many as 75% of Caucasian\\nwomen experience perimenopausally related hot flashes,\\nbeginning an average of two years prior to the cessation of\\nmenstruation. On average, 85% of these women experi-\\nence hot flashes for more than one year. Statistics are\\nmixed with regard to overall duration. One study reported\\nthat only 20% of women reported still having hot flashes\\nafter four years, while another reported 25–50% of\\nwomen continuing to have them as long as five years. Hot\\nflashes appear to be more common amongst African\\nAmerican women than among Caucasian, Japanese, His-\\npanic, or Chinese women, while Mayan Indian women re-\\nport no symptoms associated with menopause at all.\\nHot flashes may be preceded by a prodromal experi-\\nence, or set of signs, of rapid heart rate, anxiety , and\\ndizziness or weakness. There is considerable variation in\\nthe experience of hot flashes. As the flash comes on,\\nthere is a feeling of sudden heat that may produce as lit-\\ntle as a beading of perspiration on the upper lip, or a sud-\\nden and uncontrollable drenching. The sudden feeling of\\nheat may be followed by a cold, clammy sensation as\\nevaporation of perspiration occurs. The episode may last\\nfrom 30 seconds to five minutes; an average of four min-\\nutes is reported. One clinical source reported that pa-\\ntients most commonly describe the onset of hot flashes\\nas coming between two and four in morning, disrupting\\nsleep, often resulting in  a need to change nightclothes or\\neven bed linens; but another source noted that the most\\ncommon time of onset was between six and eight in the\\nmorning and six and ten at night.\\nA stressful incident may precede the hot flash, and\\nkeeping a journal of these events as a means of identify-\\ning triggers may be helpful. Depending on the intensity ,\\nseverity , and timing, embarrassment may also accompa-\\nny the hot flash when others witness the sudden, unmis-\\ntakable signs of the experience. Breast cancer, premature\\nonset of menopause, faster onset of menopause, tamox-\\nifen therapy in women and antiandrogenic therapies in\\nwomen and men, may contribute to more severe and\\nlonger-lasting hot flashes. One source noted that each\\nperson individually may themselves experience a wide\\nvariation of symptoms, dependent on their unique bio-\\nchemical, environmental, and psychosocial factors.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe exact cause and mechanism of hot flashes is not\\nwell understood. What is recognized is that as estrogen\\nlevels are depleted, whether due to surgical, chemical, or\\nnatural age-related changes, the area in the brain that\\nregulates several functions including body tempera-\\nture—the hypothalamus—becomes “confused. ” The core\\nbody temperature set point is lowered, and the threshold\\nbetween acceptable and nonacceptable body heat levels\\nis more easily crossed. When that occurs, signals are sent\\nto the rest of the body of a sudden need to discharge\\nheat, accomplished through the sudden release of perspi-\\nration from the sweat glands. Studies reveal measurable\\nrises in skin temperature. Other hypothalamic signals\\ncause awakenings from sleep, changes in blood pressure\\nand heart rate, and anxiety states (alertness), as if the\\nbody is in “fight or flight” mode.\\nA summary of common accompanying symptoms\\ninclude:\\n• sleep disruptions\\n• fatigue\\n• night sweats\\n• heart palpitations\\n• irritability\\n• short-term memory loss\\n• attention span changes\\n• depression and weepiness\\n• uncharacteristic rage or impatience\\n• dryness of eyes and vagina\\n• reduced libido and interest in sex\\n• accelerated bone loss\\nDiagnosis\\nIn most cases, diagnosis of hot flashes is not diffi-\\ncult. What may be difficult is assessing existing levels of\\nhormones, anticipating the duration of menopause and\\nmenopausal symptoms, and finding safe, effective treat-\\nment options.

Bone density testing, and depending on his-\\ntory , more regular mammograms and Pap tests, though\\nnot diagnostic of hot flashes, may become advisable.\\nT reatment\\nSeveral alternative treatments are effective.\\nPhyto- (plant-derived) hormones\\nThe most widely proclaimed remedies in this cate-\\ngory include black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa), wild\\nyam (Dioscorea villosa), dong quai (Angelica sinensis),\\nred clover (Trifollium pratense ), and licorice (Gly-\\ncyrrhiza glabra ). Also in this category are soy and two\\nsoy isoflavones—genistein and daidzein. Of all of these,\\nblack cohosh, wild yam, and soy have shown the greatest\\nefficacy . The have also incited controversy .\\nBlack cohosh may be the most well-studied of all\\nthe phytoestrogens. In North America, Native American\\nwomen have traditionally used it. The German Commis-\\nsion E, whose stamp of approval makes prescriptive use\\nof black cohosh reimbursable, recommends, according to\\none source, use for no longer than six months at doses of\\n20–40 mg daily [of the concentrate]. Apart from safety\\nissues, use of black cohosh by women also taking ta-\\nmoxifen is not as effective because of competition for es-\\ntrogen receptor sites. For women not taking tamoxifen\\nsimultaneously , the reported improvement over placebo\\nin the use of black cohosh was 25–30%. Given that the\\nplacebo effect generates a 30–50% improvement, these\\nstatistics may mean as high as a 75–80% reduction with\\nblack cohosh. Other combination formulas may include\\nblack cohosh in an unconcentrated and unstandardized\\nproduct, and may be safer for longer periods of time.\\nA study examining the reduction of hot flashes from\\nuse of soy flour showed a 40% reduction, 15% greater\\nthan placebo. However, considerable controversy about\\nan estrogen-additive effect in women at risk or with a\\nhistory of breast or uterine cancer, and in men at risk of\\nprostate cancer, warrants caution. One study noted that\\nthe soy isoflavones stimulated tumor growth and op-\\nposed any beneficial effects tamoxifen might have.\\nDong quai was reported to be equivalent to placebo\\nwith regard to hot flashes, with an advisory caution.\\nDong quai belongs to a family of herbs that contain war-\\nfarin (Coumadin)-like substances, and is therefore con-\\ntraindicated for use in persons on Coumadin (warfarin)\\nor other blood-thinning therapies.\\nWild yam and licorice have both been used and rec-\\nommended for their progesterone-like qualities. Many of\\nthe progesterone creams available without prescription\\nhave wild yam as a basic source ingredient. Many of\\nthese creams also contain pharmaceutical-grade (concen-\\ntrated and standardized) amounts of progesterone. With-\\nout monitoring use by saliva sampling, a worsening of\\nhot flashes may be provoked by progesterone’s estrogen\\nsuppressive capacity . Licorice has been historically in-\\ncluded in many combination herbals in traditional Chi-\\nnese medicine as a synergistic (exponentially additive)\\nelement; however, caution is advised for persons with\\nhigh blood pressure.\\nA study of red clover using of 252 women divided\\ninto three groups, two each using a separate red clover\\nsupplement for 12 weeks and one control group, report-\\ned a 40% improvement and no significant side effects.\\nAn average of eight hot flash episodes was reduced to an\\naverage of five in the two trial groups. When compared\\nwith estrogen’s 90% improvement statistic, these results\\nwere considered disappointing.\\nT raditional Chinese medicine (TCM)\\nTCM divides menopause into “hot” and “cold”\\nmenopause on the basis of a thorough history taking and\\nexamination of the tongue and pulses (six different puls-\\nes). Both acupuncture and Chinese herbology may be\\nemployed to reduce stress, facilitate the movement of\\nChi (or Qi, the body’s internal energy flow), and balance\\nbody systems. While some critics claim TCM is no more\\neffective than placebo in controlling hot flashes or the\\nsymptoms of menopause, with “few documented bene-\\nfits, ” others point to the survival of this tradition in medi-\\ncine for thousands of years and believe that something\\nmore than a placebo effect is evidenced.\\nV itamins and vitamin E therapy\\nVitamin E therapy is perhaps one of the most histor-\\nically recommended therapies in North America for hot\\nflashes, in a dosing range from 400–1,000 International\\nUnits (IU) daily . Since the 1940s, vitamin E has been be-\\nlieved to be useful in reducing hot flashes and another\\ncommon symptoms of estrogen deficiency—vaginal dry-\\nness. One vitamin company at least, has built a reputation\\non the clinical benefits of vitamin E therapy . Neverthe-\\nless, one source reports on the basis of a “well designed\\ntrial” that the success of vitamin E therapy (40%) for the\\nreduction of hot flashes is comparable to placebo (30%).\\nOther studies regarding the antioxidant properties of vita-\\nmin E suggest that when the vitamin is combined simul-\\ntaneously with vitamin C supplementation, a beneficial\\nsynergistic antioxidant effect is obtained. A tamoxifen-re-\\nlated trial by the National Cancer Institute recommends\\nuse of vitamin E, with C and 200–250 mg of vitamin B\\n6.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1005\\nHot flashes\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1005'),\n",

Licensed practition-\\ners and others in the healthcare community have recog-\\nnized for some time that there is a relationship between\\nhigh estrogen (estradiol or E2) levels and fibrocystic\\nbreast disease, uterine fibroids, endometriosis and fer-\\ntility dysfunction. Saliva sampling was developed as an\\nalternate means of effectively monitoring not just the\\nlevels of circulating hormone, but the amount of biologi-\\ncally active circulating hormone. The pioneer laboratory ,\\nDiagnosT echs, Inc. of Kent, W ashington, developed a fe-\\nmale hormone profile that tracks the interplay of estro-\\ngen and progesterone across the span of a menstruating\\nwoman’s cycle. They also developed a post menopausal\\npanel to assess the more static balances of women after\\nmenstruation ceases, and a testosterone panel for men.\\nInformation from these kinds of tests are valuable aids in\\nassessing an individual’s existing hormone values, espe-\\ncially when compared to statistical data of physiological-\\nly effective ranges. This information allows for safer,\\nmore precise and individual—not one size fits all—use\\nof hormone replacement therapy .\\nA special class of pharmacist, known as a com-\\npounding pharmacist, is able to formulate a hormone re-\\nplacement of “molecularly identical” phytohormones\\n(usually soy and wild yam), standardized to a calculated\\nmilligram strength, for use by prescription. These natur-\\nal estrogen replacements make broadest use of the\\nweakest, most gentle fraction of estrogen, estriol (E3).\\nThe other fractions are estradiol (E2)—the most po-\\ntent—and estrone (E1). Although natural hormones are\\navailable in capsules, the most commonly recommended\\nforms are sublingual (under the tongue) drops, or a topi-\\ncal cream or gel, in order to avoid adding further burden\\nto the liver. The liver is responsible for metabolizing the\\nchemistry of the body , and by the time hormone re-\\nplacement therapy is usually needed, the liver has been\\nhard at work for many years. Drops and creams also\\nallow for individual tailoring. Natural hormone re-\\nplacement therapy , however, must be used with the\\nsame caution as pharmaceutical synthetics, even though\\nits compounds may be safer and reduce the health risks\\nthat have become associated with synthetic hormone re-\\nplacement therapy or no treatment at all. Without clini-\\ncal trials, statistical proof and good data remain unavail-\\nable. The International Academy of Compounding Phar-\\nmacists (IACP) maintains a website to help locate com-\\npounding pharmacists: http://www .iacprx.org/about_\\niacp/ The American Association of Naturopathic Physi-\\ncians maintains a website of licensed members at:\\nhttp://www .naturopathic.org\\nLiver support and detoxification\\nBecause the liver is the primary organ for metaboliz-\\ning hormones, therapies that include a liver support or\\ndetoxification may assist in the smooth transitioning\\nthrough menopause. This might be especially important in\\npersons whose hot flashes are surgically or chemically in-\\nduced, as the need for both of these kinds of interventions\\nwas likely preceded by hormone related illness. Colon\\ncleansing and increased intake of dietary and soluble fibers\\nmay also be recommended. Sources of dietary and soluble\\nfiber include whole grains and grain brans, most vegeta-\\nbles, many fruits and fruit pectin, psyllium, and guar gum.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nPremarin and Prempro\\nFor many years, the standard remedy for relief of\\nhot flashes was Premarin, a product derived from the\\nurine of pregnant mares. During pregnancy , levels of\\nthe most potent fraction of estrogen, estradiol (E2), are\\ndowngraded to a less potent fraction, estrone (E1). (Es-\\ntrone is more potent than estriol, or E3.) Mares were kept\\npregnant, catheterized for urine collection, and dehydrat-\\ned for more concentrated urine. That fact alone was\\nenough to dissuade some women from using it. Howev-\\ner, no other single remedy had been shown to have the\\nefficacy (96%)of reducing or eliminating hot flashes like\\nestrogen (as Premarin) hormone replacement therapy .\\nMares have similar but unidentical estrogens com-\\npared to humans.

Furthermore, in\\nthe normal female’s physiology , estrogen is opposed by\\nprogesterone, another female reproductive hormone.\\nSupplementing estrogen by using Premarin, unopposed\\nby progesterone, resulted frequently in a condition\\nknown as hyperestrogenism and increased risks and rates\\nof breast and uterine cancer. Ignoring a possible genetic\\ntoxicity of premarin, subsequent prescriptions for hor-\\nmone replacement therapy concentrated on opposing\\npremarin’s estrogen in a combination patented hormone\\ndrug called Prempro. In the summer of 2002, results of\\nthe W omen’s Health Initiative study were released, sta-\\ntistically demonstrating the increased health risks (breast\\ncancer, stroke and heart attack ) of these modalities.\\nAlong with results of other studies suggesting that estro-\\ngen replacement therapy was also not as protective\\nagainst osteoporosis as had once been believed, serious\\nreconsideration of hot flashes management was prompt-\\ned. The current trend in synthetic hot flashes manage-\\nment and hormone replacement therapy is a multi-\\nfaceted approach which may include the short-term use\\nof estrogen. Several the other synthetic options are dis-\\ncussed below .\\nThe progestins\\nDepomedroxyprogesterone acetate (MP A) has been\\nreviewed and found, at doses of 150 mg every one to two\\nmonths [as an injection], for women with endometrial\\ncancer to be 85% effective in reducing hot flashes when\\ncompared with estrogen. Oral doses of 10 mg/day were\\n87% effective. Reported side effects included: irregular\\nvaginal bleeding, weight gain and bloating, breast ten-\\nderness and mood swings.\\nBlood pressure medications (antihypertensives)\\nBlood pressure medications—alpha-adrenergic ago-\\nnist antihypertensives—that inhibit the stress trigger\\npathways involved in hot flashes, reduce hot flashes 20%\\nto 65%. Drugs and dosages used include: clonidine, at\\n0.05–0.2 mg/day; lefoxidine, at 0.1 mg/day; and methyl-\\ndopa, at 250 mg three times daily . Side effects of dizzi-\\nness and dry mouth were reported.\\nBellergal\\nThe twice daily use of 40 mg of bellergal—a potent\\nhypnotic-sedative combination of ergotamine tartrate,\\nbelladona alkaloids, and phenobarbitol— reduces hot\\nflashes by 60% when compared to the placebo rate of\\n22%. This drug is one of the older synthetic remedies\\nprescribed for hot flashes, due to its effects on the ner-\\nvous system. It has the very undesirable effect of being\\naddictive, and avoidance of alcohol is strongly advised.\\nMegestrol acetate\\nOne of the newer drugs for relief of hot flashes,\\nstudied under rigorous clinical trial according to one\\nsource, a 20 mg twice daily oral dose, megestrol acetate\\nis considered to show high promise for use in both men\\nand women. It is considered as a treatment for breast\\ncancer in high continuous doses. Initial dosing is report-\\ned to start at 40 mg daily , and then be tapered up or down\\nafter a month, to a maximum of 80 mg daily . Side effects\\nnoted were fluid retention and bloating.\\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\\nNew attention is being paid to this class of drugs, es-\\npecially to Prozac (fluoxetine), Paxil (paroxetine), and\\nEffexor (venlafaxine). V enlafaxine is sometimes also no-\\ntated as an ‘NSRI’ or a norepinephrine serotonin reuptake\\ninhibitor. Norepinephrine is an adrenal hormone related\\nto feelings of ambition and depression. By relieving\\ndeficits that may affect mood and hot flashes, these reup-\\ntake inhibitors are showing a 50% to 75% efficacy in de-\\ncreasing hot flashes in 60% of women, making them bet-\\nter than trial placebo (22% to 30%) by about half. Eighty\\nper cent of the benefit was achieved in the first week. The\\nnoted dose on Paxil is 10 mg. daily for the first week, fol-\\nlowed by 20 mg daily thereafter. Dosing for Effexor was\\nnoted at 75 mg twice daily of a time released formula.\\nThe study using 75 mg followed studies using consider-\\nably less, 12.5 mg twice daily . Side effects include sexual\\ndysfunction , and, according to one source, possible\\nweight gain from increased carbohydrate craving.\\nPrognosis\\nThough some hot flashes for some women may be\\nsevere, occur over several years, be embarrassing, dis-\\nruptive, mood-altering, fatigue-inducing, and correlated\\nwith other age-related deficiencies sufficient to make a\\ngrown person cry , they are not life-threatening. The sta-\\ntistics, according to one source, that “in virtually all re-\\nported studies, hot flashes respond to placebo in 30% to\\n50% of women, ” may mean that an average 40% reduc-\\ntion in hot flashes may be obtained by visiting a health\\ncare professional, allopathic or alternative, talking about\\nconcerns, and instituting lifestyle changes representing a\\nkind of pampering or self-care. In other words, hot flash\\nsufferers may feel statistically justified in adopting new\\nways of living they might have been contemplating pre-\\nviously but have not yet adopted.\\nPrevention\\nHot flashes may represent an invitation or opportu-\\nnity to experiment with new modalities.

Nelson, N.D.\\nHou xiang see Agastache\\nHoundsbane see Horehound\\nHuang qi see Astragalus\\nHuckleberry see Bilberry\\nHumor therapy\\nDefinition\\nHumor therapy is the art of using humor and laugh-\\nter to help heal people with physical or mental illness.\\nOrigins\\nThe benefits of humor therapy were acknowledged\\nas far back as the book of Proverbs in the Old T estament,\\nwhich contains verses like Prov . 17:22: “ A cheerful heart\\nis a good medicine, but a downcast spirit dries up the\\nbones. ” The earliest historical reference to humor therapy\\nis from the fourteenth century , when French surgeon\\nHenri de Mondeville wrote, “Let the surgeon take care to\\nregulate the whole regimen of the patient’s life for joy\\nand happiness, allowing his relatives and special friends\\nto cheer him, and by having someone tell him jokes. ” In\\nthe sixteenth century , Martin Luther used a form of\\nhumor therapy as part of his pastoral counseling of de-\\npressed people. He advised them not to isolate them-\\nselves but to surround themselves with friends who could\\njoke and make them laugh. Many of Luther’s own letters\\nto other people include playful or humorous remarks.\\nModern humor therapy dates from the 1930s, when\\nclowns were brought into hospitals to cheer up children\\nhospitalized with polio. In his 1979 book, Anatomy of an\\nIllness , author Norman Cousins brought the subject of\\nhumor therapy to the attention of the medical communi-\\nty . Cousins, himself a physician, details how he used\\nlaughter to help ease his pain while undergoing treat-\\nment for rheumatoid arthritis of the spine (ankylosing\\nspondylitis). The benefits of laughter in treating the sick\\ncaptured the public’s attention in the 1998 movie P atch\\nAdams , starring Robin Williams as the real-life doctor\\nHunter “Patch” Adams. The movie is based on Adams’\\nexperiences treating the poor in rural W est V irginia, as\\nrelated in his 1983 book Gesundheit!.\\nBenefits\\nIt may seem difficult to measure the benefits of\\nlaughter in medicine, but a number of clinical studies have\\nhelped verify the adage that laughter is the best medicine.\\nIn general, laughter improves the physical, mental, emo-\\ntional, and spiritual health of individuals. Laughter ap-\\npears to release tension in the diaphragm and relieve pres-\\nsure on the liver and other internal organs. It stimulates the\\nimmune system, reduces stress, and helps balance the\\nbody’s natural energy fields or auras. People who have de-\\nveloped a strong sense of humor generally have a better\\nsense of well-being and control in their lives.\\nA strong advocate of humor therapy is Dr. Michael\\nR. W asserman, president and chief medical officer of\\nGeriMed of America, Inc., a primary care physician\\nmanagement company for seniors. “ A few years ago I\\ncame down with pneumonia , pulled out videotapes of I\\nLove Lucy reruns and laughed myself back to good\\nhealth, ” he said. “Clearly , humor and laughter have a\\npositive effect on one’s attitude and health overall. While\\nwe don’t know all of the specifics, our immune system\\nappears to benefit from these emotions. ”\\nDescription\\nHumor therapy is used in both mainstream and alter-\\nnative medicine. It can take many forms, but generally it\\nis simply the recognition by physicians, nurses, and\\nother health care practitioners of the value of mixing\\nhumor and laughter with medication and treatment. It is\\nespecially important with children and the elderly . Pa-\\ntients can also help themselves to heal by adding more\\nhumor and laughter to their lives.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1009\\nHumor therapy\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1009'),\n",

Professional\\nclowns perform three days a week at the bedsides of hos-\\npitalized children to help ease the stress of serious illness-\\nes. The clowns use juggling, mime, magic tricks, music,\\nand gags to promote the healing power of humor . Instead\\nof stethoscopes, thermometers, and hypodermics, the\\n“doctors of delight” make their “clown rounds” with\\nGroucho Marx disguises, funny hats, and rubber chickens.\\nPreparations\\nNo advance preparation is required, except possibly\\na good repertoire of jokes and gags for the therapist.\\nPrecautions\\nNot everyone will appreciate humor therapy . Some\\npeople may consider humor for the sick or injured as in-\\nappropriate or harmful. Therefore, it is important to\\nknow or sense when humor will be therapeutic and when\\nit will be inappropriate. It should be used cautiously at\\nfirst in situations in which the sensitivity of the person to\\nwhom it is directed is uncertain or unknown.\\nSide effects\\nThe only adverse side effect of humor therapy is that\\nit can cause mental hurt, sadness, and alienation in per-\\nsons who are not receptive to it, or if it is used insensi-\\ntively .\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nHumor therapy is widely accepted in the alternative\\nhealth community and is finding growing acceptance\\nwith mainstream health practitioners, especially regis-\\ntered nurses. Numerous scientific studies done in a clini-\\ncal setting support the benefits of humor therapy . T wo\\n1989 studies done at the Loma Linda (CA) University\\nSchool of Medicine showed that laughter stimulates the\\nimmune system, counteracting the immunosuppressive\\neffects of stress. These findings have been supported by\\nother studies at the UCLA Medical School Department of\\nBehavioral Medicine, the Ohio State University School of\\nMedicine, and the V A Medical Center in San Diego.\\nWhile several studies have demonstrated that humor\\ntherapy raises the level of salivary immunoglobin A, they\\nhave also been challenged. Other research focuses on the\\neffects of humor therapy on natural killer (NK) cell as-\\nsays, which are considered to give clearer and more\\nreplicable results. The general conclusion is that laughter\\nhas the potential to reduce stress and stress hormone lev-\\nels, consequently reducing their effects on the immune\\nsystem.

Max Freedom Long, who\\nrediscovered Huna in the 1920s, defined it as a system of\\nreligious psychiatry because it contains elements of reli-\\ngion, psychology , and psychic science.\\nOrigins\\nHuna practitioners believe their teachings are an-\\ncient and sacred, although at least one writer has claimed\\nthey actually have modern origins. In the Hawaiian lan-\\nguage, the word huna means “secret” or “that which is\\nhidden, ” referring to a tradition of hiding these teach-\\nings. The word is also said to be taken from kahuna ,a\\npriest or teacher who was the “keeper of the secret. ”\\nHuna has traditionally been passed on through oral com-\\nmunication and in chants rather than in writing.\\nHuna was outlawed in the nineteenth century by\\nChristian missionaries to the Hawaiian Islands. Max Free-\\ndom Long, who founded the Huna Fellowship in 1945,\\nspent years decoding the language of Huna knowledge. He\\npublished eight books on Huna between the 1920s and his\\ndeath in 1971. Serge Kahili King, a non-Polynesian kahu-\\nna, founded One Order of Huna International in 1973.\\nBenefits\\nHuna claims to offer the following benefits to its ad-\\nherents:\\n• becoming a complete person psychologically\\n• solving personal problems, including financial or social\\nissues\\n• having a higher level of physical, emotional, and spiri-\\ntual energy\\n• handling the demands and stresses of daily life more\\neffectively\\n• acquiring the ability to heal oneself and others\\n• learning how to accumulate mana (vital force) in order\\nto attain personal goals\\n• growing spiritually\\n• changing one’s future\\nDescription\\nThe specific teachings and customs associated with\\nHuna vary somewhat from island to island. All agree, how-\\never, on the concept of three spirits or minds in the human\\nbeing. According to Huna, the complete being consists of a\\nphysical body inhabited by two of the three minds: the “low\\nself” which is below the level of consciousness, and the\\n“middle self” which is the conscious mind. The middle self\\nis what others perceive as one’s personality . The third spirit\\nor mind, the High Self, is outside the body . Each person has\\na transparent shadow body that completely duplicates the\\nphysical body . This shadow body is called the aka. The aka\\nis like a pattern or blueprint that connects the three selves. It\\nhas a sticky and stretchy quality that allows it to form con-\\nnections between an individual and another person or ob-\\nject. When someone touches, looks at, or even thinks of\\nsomething, a thread or cord from the aka attaches to it,\\nforming an energy channel between the person and another\\nperson or object. Illness develops when there is a conflict\\nbetween the conscious mind and the patterns of the aka.\\nThe third mind or self, the High Self, is not God but\\na person’s divine connection with God. Ideally all three\\nselves or minds in a person should be in continual contact\\nwith one another. The low self is the communication link\\nbetween the middle self and the High Self. It obtains in-\\nformation directly from the senses and is the seat of the\\nemotions. It has a limited ability to reason and reacts to\\nevents only on the basis of previous programming even if\\nthis programming has been incorrect or negative. Block-\\nages in the low self caused by fear, anger, or negative pro-\\ngramming interrupt communication with the High Self.\\nThe function of the kahuna is to remove these blocks.\\nKahunas use a wide range of techniques including telepa-\\nthy , rituals, massage, body stroking, herbs, dream work to\\nclear the mind of limiting beliefs and fears, meditative\\nmovements known as kalana hula, and a variety of other\\nself-development techniques to establish harmony among\\npeople, objects, locations, and circumstances. An exam-\\nple of the latter is Ho’oponopono , which refers to coun-\\nseling and mediation to balance relationships.\\nThe three minds or selves use a form of subtle ener-\\ngy called mana, which is stored in the aka. The low self\\ntakes energy from food and turns it into mana, or basic\\nlife energy . The kahunas, who serve as conduits for the\\nhealing qualities of mana, use breathing techniques to in-\\ncrease a person’s mana. The basic breathing technique\\ninvolves drawing a deep breath, holding it, and willing\\nthe mana into a body part that needs healing, into the\\nhands, or into an object like a crystal or talisman. A per-\\nson’s mana is also increased by living correctly . Huna\\nemphasizes the importance of living and speaking posi-\\ntively , and of doing no harm to others.\\nPractitioners of Huna also emphasize that their way\\nof life is accessible to everyone and can be practiced by\\neveryone; that is, it does not depend on having unusual\\npsychic gifts or on joining a small group of “chosen” ini-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1011\\nHuna\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1011'),\n",

His formal education was sporadic at best.\\nHowever , Priessnitz possessed a level head and a high\\ndegree of intelligence along with a keen and active mind.\\nAs he matured he became extremely aware of his sur-\\nroundings in nature.\\nAt age 16, Priessnitz fell from a horse and was seri-\\nously hoofed by the animal. He received the morbid prog-\\nnosis that he might be crippled at best, or might die at\\nworst. He set to treating his own chest wound with cold\\npacks, in emulation of a doe that he had once observed\\nbathing a wound in a cool mountain stream. The hy-\\ndrotherapy regimen proved highly effective and drew con-\\nsiderable attention to his small hometown of Gräfenberg.\\nIn 1822 he rebuilt the family home, renovating its wooden\\nframe into a solid brick spa structure. The spa, known as\\nthe castle, housed as many as 1,500 guests each year by\\n1839. Among the guests were medical professionals who\\nwere intent upon exposing the therapy as a sham.\\nDetractors notwithstanding, word of the simple and\\neffective treatment spread to Vienna, where Priessnitz\\ntraveled on occasion to provide counsel at the emperor’ s\\ncourt.

Hormones are messenger\\nsubstances, substances produced in one gland or area of\\nthe body that move through the blood and stimulate ac-\\ntivity in other glands or areas. Glucocorticoid hormones\\naffect carbohydrate and protein metabolism. Steroid hor-\\nmones are hormones related to cholesterol . Hypercorti-\\nsolemia refers to high amounts of circulating cortisol and\\nmay be a pathological or non-pathological condition.\\nDescription\\nPathological hypercortisolemia, or Cushing’s syn-\\ndrome, named after the United States surgeon, Harvey\\nCushing (1869–1939), may result from a lung cancer ,\\ntumor of the pituitary or adrenal glands, or from kidney\\nfailure. Nonpathological hypercortisolemia is a normal\\nresponse of pregnancy , and to such traumas, as acci-\\ndents or surgery (including circumcision, studies show),\\nsome forms of depression and stress. Over time, contin-\\nued exposure to trauma and stress may produce chronic\\nhypercortisolemia and result in serious long-term debili-\\ntating illness.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe natural regulation of cortisol is governed by a\\ncircular feedback response system. Output is initiated\\nwhen pituitary gland secretions of adrenocorticotropin\\nhormone (ACTH) travel to and stimulate the adrenal\\nglands located atop the kidneys near the middle of the\\nupper back. From the adrenals, cortisol travels to its tar-\\nget tissues, initiating a series of reactions known as the\\n“flight-or-fight” response. Information from these target\\ntissues is monitored by the brain. If the messages re-\\nceived tell the brain that more help is needed, the pitu-\\nitary gland is stimulated to secrete more ACTH, which\\nstimulates increased secretion of cortisol. The most sig-\\nnificant feedback factor is stress. When stress levels are\\nreported to the brain as high, high levels of cortisol are\\nreleased in response. When stress remains high indefi-\\nnitely , cortisol levels may also remain high indefinitely ,\\nproducing a series of biochemical, physiological and\\neven anatomical reactions.\\nNormally , cortisol output has a diurnal and circadian\\nrhythm, rising in the morning, falling at night, and changing\\nwith the seasons. Changes related to work-sleep cycles af-\\nfect this rhythm, and changes in the rhythm affect night time\\nsleep patterns. Changes in the length of daylight hours,\\nblindness, and loss of consciousness also affects the rhythm.\\nCortisol target tissues include:\\n• liver\\n• bone\\n• blood vessels\\n• kidney\\n• muscle\\n• brain\\n• immune system\\nLong-term exposure to cortisol, whether natural or\\nsynthetic—from such steroid drugs as prednisone, dexam-\\nethasone (Decadron), and Methylprednisone (Medrol)—\\nmay eventually result in such changes as osteoporosis ,\\nmuscle weakening and wasting, high blood pressure, in-\\ncreased abdominal fat deposition, immune dysfunction,\\nsteroid-induced diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. An-\\nother serious consequence may be the eventual fatigue\\nand failure of the adrenal glands. Cushing’s syndrome\\nclassic symptoms include, in addition to “normal” long-\\nterm symptoms, a “moon face” (rounded), thinning of the\\nskin accompanied by purple or pink stretch marks and\\neasy bruising, acne, increased facial and body hair and de-\\ncreased scalp hair in women, and fatigue.\\nDiagnosis\\nInitial diagnosis may be made through the office of a\\nfamily practice physician or internist on the basis of signs\\nand symptoms, physical examination, and lab work includ-\\ning testing levels of circulating cortisol. Three types of test-\\ning are available to check cortisol levels: 24-hour urine col-\\nlection; blood testing; and, saliva sampling. The 24-hour\\nurine collection test is done at home beginning after the\\nfirst urination of the morning and finishing after the first\\nurination of the following day . This test can be done on in-\\nfants. No special preparation is necessary . The test is de-\\nscribed as not uncomfortable. Special considerations were\\nreported to include emotional or physical stress and med-\\nications: lithium, diuretics, estrogen, tricyclic antidepres-\\nsants, ketoconazole, and glucocorticoids. Blood testing re-\\nquires a visit to a lab, where blood is drawn and then ana-\\nlyzed. This test can be performed on infants, children and\\nadults. Preparation for the test may include discontinuation\\nof medications similar to those medications listed above, as\\nadvised by one’s healthcare provider.

The surfaces of the lens\\nand cornea are not perpendicular to the incoming light,\\nso the direction of the light changes. The greater the cur-\\nvature of the lens system, the greater the change in the\\ndirection of the light.\\nWhen parallel light rays pass through the lens system\\nof the eye, they are bent so they converge at a point some\\ndistance behind the lens. With perfect vision, this point of\\nconvergence where the light rays are focused lies on the\\nretina. Hyperopia is the condition in which the point of\\nfocus of parallel light rays from an object lies behind the\\nretina. This condition exists when the eyeball depth is too\\nshort for the curvature of its lens system.\\nThere is a connection between the focusing of the lens\\nof the eye (accommodation) and convergence of the eyes (the\\ntwo eyes turning in to look at a close object). A good example\\nis during reading, when the lens accommodates to make the\\nclose-up material clear and the eyes turn in to look at the print\\nand keep it from doubling. Because of this connection be-\\ntween accommodation and convergence, if the lens needs to\\naccommodate and focus for distance (to bring the image back\\nonto the retina), the eyes may appear to turn in.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nBabies are generally born slightly hyperopic, but\\nthis symptom tends to decrease with age. There is nor-\\nmal variation in eyeball length and curvature of the lens\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1019'),\n",

If the hyper-\\nopia is not too severe, the lens may be able to accommo-\\ndate and bring the image back onto the retina. This acco-\\nmodation results in clear distance vision, but the constant\\nfocusing could cause headaches or eyestrain. If the lens\\ncannot accommodate for the full extent of the hyperopia,\\nthe distant image is blurry . If the eyes are focused for\\ndistance and the person is looking at a nearby object, the\\nlens needs to accommodate further. This need may result\\nin blurry nearby objects or headaches during close work.\\nSymptoms depend on the degree of hyperopia.\\nSome individuals may have no symptoms, while others\\nhave blurry near vision and clear distance vision, and\\nthose with the most severe cases have blurry near and\\ndistance vision.

A turned eye could also signal a more serious\\nproblem, so a physician should be consulted.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause it is possible to have good visual acuity with\\nsome degree of hyperopia it, is important to relax accom-\\nmodation before an eye exam. This is done with the use\\nof eye drops and is called a cycloplegic exam, or cyclo-\\nplegic refraction. The patient’s visual status can be deter-\\nmined with a hand-held instrument called a retinoscope\\nand/or by having the patient read from an eye chart while\\nplacing different lenses in front of the patient’s eyes.

Odle\\nHyperparathyroidism\\nDefinition\\nHyperparathyroidism is the overproduction by the\\nparathyroid glands of a hormone called parathyroid hor-\\nmone (parathormone). Parathyroid glands are four pea-sized\\nglands located just behind the thyroid gland in the front of\\nthe neck. Parathyroid hormone (parathormone) helps regu-\\nlate the levels of calciumand phosphorus in the body .\\nDescription\\nThyroid glands and parathyroid glands, despite their\\nsimilar names and proximity , are entirely separate, and\\neach produces hormones with different functions.\\nHyperparathyroidism may be primary or secondary .\\nIt most often occurs in patients over age 30, and most\\ncommonly in patients 50 to 60 years old. It rarely occurs\\nin children or the elderly . W omen are affected by the dis-\\ncessful, but complications, including worsening of vi-\\nsion, may occur.\\nIn mid-2002, the Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) approved a new surgical technique to correct hy-\\nperopia. Called conductive keratoplasty , it involves no\\ncutting or removal of tissue. An ophthalmologist uses a\\nsmall probe about the size of a human hair to pass ra-\\ndiofrequency waves that produce heat into the corneal tis-\\nsue. The waves shrink the tissue and reshape the cornea.\\nExpected results\\nThe prognosis for fully corrected vision is excellent\\nfor patients with low to moderate degrees of hyperopia.\\nPatients with very high hyperopia may not achieve full\\ncorrection.\\nHyperopia increases the chances of chronic glauco-\\nma, but vision loss from glaucoma is preventable.\\nPrevention\\nHyperopia is usually present at birth and cannot be\\nprevented.

Reproduced by permission.)\\nparathyroidism is one of the most common endocrine\\ndisorders, led only by diabetes and hyperthyroidism.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nOften, there are no obvious symptoms to give rise to\\nsuspicion of hyperparathyroidism, and it is first diag-\\nnosed when a patient is discovered to be hypercalcemic\\nduring a routine blood chemistry profile. Patients may\\nbelieve they have been feeling fine, but realize improve-\\nments in sleep, irritability , and memory following treat-\\nment. When symptoms are present, they may include de-\\nvelopment of gastric ulcers or pancreatitis because high\\ncalcium levels can cause inflammation and pain in the\\nlinings of the stomach and pancreas.\\nMost of the symptoms of hyperparathyroidism are\\nthose present as a result of hypercalcemia, such as kidney\\nstones, osteoporosis, or bone degradation resulting from\\nthe bones giving up calcium. Muscle weakness, central\\nnervous system disturbances such as depression , psy-\\nchomotor and personality disturbances, and even coma\\ncan occur. Patients also may experience heartburn,\\nnausea, constipation, or abdominal pain. In secondary hy-\\nperparathyroidism, patients may show such signs of calci-\\num imbalance as deformities of the long bones. Symp-\\ntoms of the underlying disease also may be present.\\nMost commonly , hyperparathyroidism occurs as the\\nresult of a single adenoma, or benign tumor, in one of the\\nparathyroid glands. About 90 percent of all cases of hy-\\nperparathyroidism are caused by an adenoma. The tu-\\nmors seldom are cancerous. They will grow to a much\\nlarger size than the parathyroid glands, often to the size\\nof a walnut. Genetic disorders or multiple endocrine tu-\\nmors also can cause a parathyroid gland to enlarge and\\noversecrete hormone. In 10 percent or fewer of patients\\nwith primary hyperparathyroidism, there is enlargement\\nof all four parathyroid glands. This condition is called\\nparathyroid hyperplasia.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of hyperparathyroidism most often is\\nmade when a blood test (radioimmunoassay) reveals\\nhigh levels of parathyroid hormone and calcium. A blood\\ntest that specifically measures the amount of parathyroid\\nhormone has made diagnosis simpler. Hypercalcemia is\\nmild or intermittent in some patients, but persistent hy-\\npercalcemia is an excellent indicator of primary hyper-\\nparathyroidism. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry\\n(DEXA or DXA), a tool used to diagnose and measure\\nosteoporosis, may be used once the diagnosis is made to\\nshow reduction in bone mass for primary hyperparathry-\\nroidism patients. Once a diagnosis of hyperparathy-\\nroidism is reached, the physician will probably order fur-\\nease up to three times more often than men. It is estimat-\\ned that 28 of every 100,000 people in the United States\\nwill develop hyperparathyroidism each year.\\nNormally , parathyroid glands produce the parathor-\\nmone as calcium levels drop and lower to meet the de-\\nmands of a growing skeleton, pregnancy , or lactation.\\nHowever, when one or more parathyroid glands malfunc-\\ntion, it can lead to overproduction of the hormone and el-\\nevated calcium level in the blood. Therefore, a common\\nresult of hyperparathyroidism is hypercalcemia, or an\\nabnormally high level of calcium in the blood.\\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism occurs as a malfunc-\\ntion of one of the glands, usually as a result of a benign\\ntumor called an adenoma. Secondary hyperparathy-\\nroidism occurs as the result of an abnormality outside the\\nparathyroid glands related to the body’s metabolism, or\\nchemical changes in living cells that help provide the\\nbody’s energy . These changes cause a resistance to the\\nfunction of the parathyroid hormones. Primary hyper-\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1022'),\n",

For example, ab-\\ndominal radiographs might reveal kidney stones.\\nFor secondary hyperparathyroidism, normal or\\nslightly decreased calcium levels in the blood and vari-\\nable phosphorous levels may be visible. A patient history\\nof familial kidney disease or convulsive disorders may\\nsuggest a diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism.\\nOther tests may reveal a disease or disorder that is caus-\\ning the secondary hyperparathyroidism.\\nT reatment\\nNutritional therapy\\nLimiting intake of soft drinks can help to prevent\\nhyperparathyroidism. Soda drinks contain high levels of\\nphosphorus. High phosphorus intake can cause\\nhypocalcemia that leads to secondary hyperparathy-\\nroidism. In patients with hyperparathyroidism, forcing\\nfluids and reducing intake of calcium-rich foods can help\\ndecrease calcium levels prior to surgery or if surgery is\\nnot necessary . These patients should not take any supple-\\nments that contain calcium without a doctor’s approval.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nHyperparathyroidism cases will usually be referred\\nto an endocrinologist, who is a physician specializing in\\nhormonal problems, or a nephrologist, who specializes\\nin kidney and mineral disorders.\\nPatients with mild cases of hyperparathyroidism\\nmay not need immediate treatment if they have only\\nslight elevations in blood calcium level and normal kid-\\nneys and bones. These patients should be regularly\\nchecked, probably as often as every six months, by phys-\\nical examination and measurement of kidney function\\nand calcium levels. A bone densitometry—a test to diag-\\nnose and monitor osteoporosis or thinning of bones—\\nmeasurement should be performed every one or two\\nyears. After several years with no worsened symptoms,\\nthe length of time between tests may be increased.\\nPatients with more advanced hyperparathyroidism\\nusually will have all or half of the affected parathyroid\\ngland or glands surgically removed. This surgery is rela-\\ntively safe and effective. The primary risks are those asso-\\nciated with general anesthesia. There are some instances\\nin which the surgery can be performed with the patient\\nunder regional, or cervical (neck) block, anesthesia.\\nOften such studies as ultrasonography—a test with high-\\nfrequency sound waves (ultrasound) that are bounced off\\ntissues and echoes are converted to pictures called sono-\\ngrams— prior to surgery help pinpoint the affected areas.\\nTreatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in-\\nvolves removing or treating the underlying cause. In\\n2004, a new drug therapy was shown to lower parathyroid\\nlevels and improve calcium and phosphorus function in\\npatients receiving dialysis (a blood-purifying treatment\\noften performed on people with kidney diseases) who had\\nuncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism. The drug,\\ncalled cinacalcet, was approved by the U.S. Food and\\nDrug Administration for people who have chronic kidney\\ndisease with secondary hyperparathyroidism.\\nExpected results\\nRemoval of the enlarged parathyroid gland or glands\\n(parathyroidectomy) cures the disease 95 percent of the\\ntime. Relief of bone pain may occur in as few as three\\ndays. In 2004, a study showed that parathyroidectomy\\nimproved depression in patients with hyperparathy-\\nroidism.

Odle\\nHypertension\\nDefinition\\nHypertension is the medical term for high blood pres-\\nsure. Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against\\nthe walls of arteries as it flows through them. Arteries are\\nthe blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood from the\\nheart to the body’s tissues.\\nDescription\\nAs blood flows through arteries, it pushes against\\nthe inside of the artery walls. The more pressure the\\nblood exerts on the artery walls, the higher the blood\\npressure. The size of small arteries also affects the blood\\npressure. When the muscular walls of arteries are re-\\nlaxed, or dilated, the pressure of the blood flowing\\nthrough them is lower than when the artery walls are nar-\\nrow , or constricted.\\nBlood pressure is highest when the heart beats to\\npump blood out into the arteries. When the heart relaxes\\nto fill with blood again, the pressure is at its lowest point.\\nBlood pressure when the heart beats is called systolic\\npressure. Blood pressure when the heart is at rest is called\\ndiastolic pressure. When blood pressure is measured, the\\nsystolic pressure is stated first and the diastolic pressure\\nsecond. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of\\nmercury (mm Hg). For example, if a person’s systolic\\npressure is 120 and diastolic pressure is 80, it is written as\\n120/80 mm Hg. The American Heart Association consid-\\ners blood pressure above 140 over 90 high for adults.\\nHypertension is a major health problem, especially\\nbecause it has no symptoms. Many people have hyper-\\ntension without knowing it. In the United States, about\\n50 million people age sixty and older have high blood\\npressure. Hypertension is more common in men than\\nwomen and in people over the age of 65 than in younger\\npersons. More than half of all Americans over the age of\\n65 have hypertension. It is also more common in\\nAfrican-Americans than in white Americans.\\nHypertension is serious because people with the\\ncondition have a higher risk for heart disease and other\\nmedical problems than people with normal blood pres-\\nsure. Serious complications can be avoided by getting\\nregular blood pressure checks and treating hypertension\\nas soon as it is diagnosed.\\nIf left untreated, hypertension can lead to the follow-\\ning medical conditions:\\n• arteriosclerosis, also called atherosclerosis\\n• blindness\\n• heart attack\\n• stroke\\n• enlarged heart\\n• kidney damage\\nArteriosclerosis is hardening of the arteries. The\\nwalls of arteries have a layer of muscle and elastic tissue\\nthat makes them flexible and able to dilate and constrict\\nas blood flows through them. High blood pressure can\\nmake the artery walls thicken and harden. When artery\\nwalls thicken, the inside of the blood vessel narrows.\\nCholesterol and fats are more likely to build up on the\\nwalls of damaged arteries, making them even narrower.\\nBlood clots can also get trapped in narrowed arteries,\\nblocking the flow of blood.\\nArteries narrowed by arteriosclerosis may not deliv-\\ner enough blood to organs and other tissues. Reduced or\\nblocked blood flow to the heart can cause a heart attack.\\nIf an artery to the brain is blocked, a stroke can result.\\nHypertension makes the heart work harder to pump\\nblood through the body . The extra workload can make\\nthe heart muscle thicken and stretch.

If hypertension thickens the arteries to the kidneys,\\nless waste can be filtered from the blood. As the condition\\nworsens, the kidneys fail and wastes build up in the\\nblood. Dialysis or a kidney transplant are needed when\\nthe kidneys fail. About 25% of people who receive kid-\\nney dialysis have kidney failure caused by hypertension.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nMany different actions or situations can normally raise\\nblood pressure. Physical activity can temporarily raise\\nblood pressure. Stressful situations can make blood pres-\\nsure go up. When the stress goes away , blood pressure\\nusually returns to normal. These temporary increases in\\nblood pressure are not considered hypertension. A diagno-\\nsis of hypertension is made only when a person has multi-\\nple high blood pressure readings over a period of time.\\nThe cause of hypertension is not known in 90–95%\\nof the people who have it. Hypertension without a known\\ncause is called primary or essential hypertension. When a\\nperson has hypertension caused by another medical con-\\ndition, it is called secondary hypertension. Secondary hy-\\npertension can be caused by a number of different illness-\\nes. Many people with kidney disorders have secondary\\nhypertension. The kidneys regulate the balance of salt\\nand water in the body . If the kidneys cannot rid the body\\nof excess salt and water, blood pressure goes up. Kidney\\ninfections, a narrowing of the arteries that carry blood to\\nthe kidneys, called renal artery stenosis, and other kidney\\ndisorders can disturb the salt and water balance.\\nCushing’s syndrome and tumors of the pituitary and\\nadrenal glands often increase levels of the adrenal gland\\nhormones cortisol, adrenalin, and aldosterone, which can\\ncause hypertension. Other conditions that can cause hy-\\npertension are blood vessel diseases, thyroid gland disor-\\nders, some prescribed drugs,alcoholism, and pregnancy.\\nEven though the cause of most hypertension is not\\nknown, some people have risk factors that give them a\\ngreater chance of getting hypertension. Many of these\\nrisk factors can be changed to lower the chance of devel-\\noping hypertension or as part of a treatment program to\\nlower blood pressure.\\nRisk factors for hypertension include:\\n• age over 60\\n• male sex\\n• race (The African-American community has a higher\\nincidence of hypertension.)\\n• heredity\\n• salt sensitivity\\n• obesity\\n• inactive lifestyle\\n• heavy alcohol consumption\\n• use of oral contraceptives\\nSome risk factors for hypertension can be changed,\\nwhile others cannot. Age, male sex, and race are risk\\nfactors that a person cannot deter. Some people inherit a\\ntendency to get hypertension. People with family mem-\\nbers who have hypertension are more likely to develop\\nit than those whose relatives are not hypertensive. Peo-\\nple with these risk factors can avoid or eliminate the\\nother risk factors to lower their chance of developing\\nhypertension.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause hypertension does not cause symptoms, it is\\nimportant to have blood pressure checked regularly .\\nBlood pressure is measured with an instrument called a\\nsphygmomanometer. A cloth-covered rubber cuff is\\nwrapped around the upper arm and inflated. When the\\ncuff is inflated, an artery in the arm is squeezed to mo-\\nmentarily stop the flow of blood. Then, the air is let out of\\nthe cuff while a stethoscope placed over the artery is used\\nto detect the sound of the blood spurting back through the\\nartery . This first sound is the systolic pressure, the pres-\\nsure when the heart beats. The last sound heard as the rest\\nof the air is released is the diastolic pressure, the pressure\\nbetween heartbeats. Both sounds are recorded on the\\nmercury gauge on the sphygmomanometer.\\nA number of such factors as pain, stress, or anxiety\\ncan cause a temporary increase in blood pressure.

If a blood pressure\\nreading is 140/90 or higher for the first time, the physi-\\ncian will have the person return for another blood pres-\\nsure check. Diagnosis of hypertension usually is made\\nbased on two or more readings after the first visit. Some-\\ntimes, patients have high blood pressure only while in\\nthe doctor’s office. This phenomenon, called “white-coat\\nhypertension” has usually been dismissed as mere anxi-\\nety over visiting the doctor. In late 2001, an Italian study\\nquestioned dismissal of these patients as not being hy-\\npertensive and encouraged further study .\\nSystolic hypertension of the elderly is common and\\nis diagnosed when the diastolic pressure is normal or\\nlow , but the systolic is elevated, e.g.170/70 mm Hg.

A\\nfamily history of hypertension might suggest a genetic\\npredisposition to the disorder.\\nThe physical exam may include several blood pres-\\nsure readings at different times and in different positions.\\nThe physician uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds\\nmade by the heart and blood flowing through the arter-\\nies. The pulse, reflexes, height, and weight are checked\\nand recorded. Internal organs are palpated, or felt, to de-\\ntermine if they are enlarged.\\nBecause hypertension can cause damage to the\\nblood vessels in the eyes, the eyes may be checked with\\nan instrument called an ophthalmoscope. The physician\\nwill look for thickening, narrowing, or hemorrhages in\\nthe blood vessels.\\nA chest x ray can detect an enlarged heart, other\\nheart abnormalities, or lung disease.\\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electrical\\nactivity of the heart. It can detect if the heart muscle is\\nenlarged and if there is damage to the heart muscle from\\nblocked arteries.\\nUrine and blood tests may be done to further evalu-\\nate health and to detect the presence of disorders that\\nmight cause hypertension.\\nT reatment\\nThere is no cure for primary hypertension, but blood\\npressure can almost always be lowered with the correct\\ntreatment. The goal of treatment is to lower blood pres-\\nsure to levels that will prevent heart disease and other\\ncomplications of hypertension. In secondary hyperten-\\nsion, the disease that is responsible for the hypertension\\nis treated in addition to the hypertension itself. Success-\\nful treatment of the underlying disorder may cure the\\nsecondary hypertension.\\nTreatment to lower blood pressure usually includes\\nchanges in diet and getting regular exercise . Patients\\nwith mild or moderate hypertension who do not have\\ndamage to the heart or kidneys may first be treated pri-\\nmarily with lifestyle changes.\\nLifestyle changes that may reduce blood pressure by\\nabout 5–10 mm Hg include:\\n• reducing salt intake\\n• reducing fat intake\\n• losing weight\\n• getting regular exercise\\n• quitting smoking\\n• reducing alcohol consumption\\n• managing stress\\nNatural remedies approved by a physician may also\\nlower or even prevent hypertension. Aromatherapy as a\\ntreatment option uses essential oils either inhaled from a\\nbottle in times of anxiety or massaged daily into the skin\\nat bedtime in the area beneath the collarbone.

Numerous drugs have been developed\\nto treat hypertension. The choice of medication will de-\\npend on the stage of hypertension, side effects, other\\nmedical conditions the patient may have, and other med-\\nicines the patient is taking.\\nPatients with mild or moderate hypertension are ini-\\ntially treated with monotherapy , a single antihyperten-\\nsive medicine. If treatment with a single medicine fails\\nto lower blood pressure sufficiently , a different medicine\\nmay be tried or another medicine may be added to the\\nfirst. Patients with more severe hypertension may initial-\\nly be given a combination of medicines to control their\\nhypertension. Combining antihypertensive medicines\\nwith different types of action often controls blood pres-\\nsure with smaller doses of each drug than would be\\nneeded for monotherapy .\\nAntihypertensive medicines fall into several classes:\\n• diuretics\\n• beta-blockers\\n• calcium channel blockers\\n• angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE in-\\nhibitors)\\n• alpha-blockers\\n• alpha-beta blockers\\n• vasodilators\\n• peripheral-acting adrenergic antagonists\\n• centrally-acting agonists\\nDiuretics help the kidneys eliminate excess salt and\\nwater from the body’s tissues and the blood. This helps\\nreduce the swelling caused by fluid buildup in the tis-\\nsues. The reduction of fluid dilates the walls of arteries\\nand lowers blood pressure.\\nBeta-blockers lower blood pressure by acting on the\\nnervous system to slow the heart rate and reduce the\\nforce of the heart’s contraction. They are used with cau-\\ntion in patients with heart failure, asthma , diabetes, or\\ncirculation problems in the hands and feet.\\nCalcium channel blockers block the entry of calci-\\num into muscle cells in artery walls.

The erysipelas resulted in a high fever ranging\\nfrom 104°F to 105.8°F (40°C to 41°C). Over the next 20\\nyears, Coley performed a series of experiments to study\\nthe effects of elevated temperature on various forms of\\ncancer. After experimenting on animals, Coley moved to\\ntreating human cancer patients, injecting them with bac-\\nteria to induce high fevers. The bacteria he used are\\nknown as Coley’s toxins.

In the 1960s, a Cleveland surgeon\\nand breast cancer specialist, George Crile Jr., published\\nseveral studies of his experiments in eliminating tumors\\nin mice using heat. Another doctor, Harry Leveen of\\nSouth Carolina, began building machines that used radio\\nfrequencies to heat either the whole body or affected\\nparts. But Leveen’s machines were not approved by the\\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) and Leveen took\\nhis inventory to the University of Bangor in W ales. Hy-\\nperthermia did not receive much attention in the United\\nStates after this point, but practitioners in other coun-\\ntries, particularly Germany , Italy , and Mexico, have re-\\nported good results with it. An international congress on\\nhyperthermia has been held each year since 1977.\\nBenefits\\nHyperthermia has been shown in several studies to re-\\nduce malignant tumors either alone or in combination\\nwith chemotherapy . A 1998 study of patients with breast\\nand ovarian cancer found that hyperthermia therapy in-\\ncreased the effectiveness of chemotherapy . This study sug-\\ngested that patients undergoing hyperthermia might be\\nsuccessfully treated with lower doses of chemotherapy . A\\n2003 study demonstrated that women with breast cancer\\nwere less likely to experience spread of the cancer to dis-\\ntant lymph nodes or the lungs if they received a combina-\\ntion of whole-body hyperthermia and chemotherapy . A\\nform of localized hyperthermia used to treat benign en-\\nlarged prostate glands can be performed in a doctor’ s of-\\nfice in as little as an hour, and this method does not have\\nthe side effects, such as impotence and incontinence, that\\noften accompany traditional prostate surgery .\\nNewer methods of hyperthermia involving noninva-\\nsive (no penetration of skin) microwave technology have\\nbeen introduced in other countries and were making their\\nway to the United States in early 2002. This technology\\noffered excellent results for some cancer patients in im-\\nproving five-year survival rates for some aggressive\\nforms of cancer when combined with other cancer thera-\\npy procedures.\\nDescription\\nHyperthermia therapy involves raising the body’s\\ninternal temperature, and this can be brought about by\\nseveral methods. Hyperthermia can involve the whole\\nbody , or just an affected local region. For reducing an\\nenlarged prostate, doctors use a device approved by the\\nFDA in 1996 that delivers microwaves to the prostate,\\nwhile water cools the surrounding tissue to prevent\\nburns. For whole-body hyperthermia, a method used in\\nEurope employs a tent-like device that delivers infrared\\nlight to the body . The patient is injected with toxins to\\nprovoke a mild fever and then monitored under lights.\\nThe lights produce a slow rise in temperature, optimally\\nto 107.6°F (42°C).

Odle\\nHyperthyroidism\\nDefinition\\nHyperthyroidism is the overproduction of thyroid\\nhormones by an overactive thyroid gland.\\nDescription\\nLocated in the front of the neck, the thyroid gland\\nproduces the hormones thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyro-\\nnine (T3 ) that regulate the body’s metabolic rate by help-\\ning to form protein ribonucleic acid (RNA) and increas-\\ning oxygen absorption in every cell. In turn, the produc-\\ntion of these hormones is controlled by a thyroid-stimu-\\nlating hormone (TSH) that is produced by the pituitary\\ngland. When production of the thyroid hormones in-\\ncreases despite the level of TSH being produced, hyper-\\nthyroidism occurs. The excessive amount of thyroid hor-\\nmones in the blood increases the body’s metabolism,\\ncreating both mental and physical symptoms.\\nThe term hyperthyroidism covers any disease that re-\\nsults in an overabundance of thyroid hormone. Other\\nnames for hyperthyroidism, or specific diseases within\\nthe category , include Graves’ disease, diffuse toxic goiter,\\nBasedow’s disease, Parry’s disease, and thyrotoxicosis.\\nHyperthyroidism affects 2.5 million people in the United\\nStates, but could affect up to 4.5 million people because\\nmore than half of the people with thyroid disease don’t\\nknow they have it. Although it occurs at all ages, hyper-\\nthyroidism is most likely to occur after the age of 15.\\nThere is a form of hyperthyroidism called neonatal\\nGraves’ disease, which occurs in infants born of mothers\\nwith Graves’ disease. Occult hyperthyroidism may occur\\nin patients over age 65 and is characterized by a distinct\\nlack of typical symptoms. Diffuse toxic goiter occurs in\\nas many as 80% of patients with hyperthyroidism.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nHyperthyroidism is often associated with the body’s\\nproduction of auto-antibodies in the blood that cause the\\nthyroid to grow and secrete excess thyroid hormone.\\nThis condition, as well as other forms of hyperthy-\\nroidism, may be inherited. Regardless of the cause, hy-\\nperthyroidism produces the same symptoms, including\\nweight loss with increased appetite, shortness of breath\\nand fatigue, intolerance to heat, heart palpitations\\n(strong, very fast heartbeats), increased frequency of\\nbowel movements, weak muscles, tremors, anxiety, and\\ndifficulty sleeping. W omen also may notice decreased\\nmenstrual flow and irregular menstrual cycles.\\nPatients with Graves’ disease often have a goiter (visi-\\nble enlargement of the thyroid gland), although as many as\\nten percent do not. These patients also may have bulging\\neyes. Thyroid storm, a serious form of hyperthyroidism,\\nmay show up as sudden and acute symptoms, some of which\\nmimic typical hyperthyroidism but with the addition of\\nfever, substantial weakness, extreme restlessness, confusion,\\nemotional swings or psychosis, and perhaps even coma.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysicians will look for physical signs and symptoms\\nindicated by patient history . On inspection, the physician\\nmay note symptoms such as a goiter or eye-bulging. Other\\nsymptoms or family history may be clues to a diagnosis of\\nhyperthyroidism. An elevated basal (lowest range of nor-\\nmal) body temperature above 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37\\ndegrees centigrade) may be an indication of a heightened\\nbasal metabolic rate (which measures the energy used to\\nmaintain vitality) and hyperthyroidism. A simple blood\\ntest can be performed to determine the amount of thyroid\\nhormone in the patient’s blood. The diagnosis usually is\\nstraightforward with this combination of clinical history ,\\nphysical examination, and routine blood hormone tests.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21030\\nHyperthyroidism\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nSarcoma —A malignant growth in the connective\\ntissue, bone, cartilage or muscle; usually the most\\nlethal form of cancer .\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1030'),\n",

One out of 400 patients\\nwould die, not from the surgical procedure, but from the\\nanesthesia. Dr .

He would get his patients into a hypnotic\\nstate and discuss their fears with them, telling them they\\nwould feel a lot better following surgery .

At age 15 he entered the Jesuit\\nCollege at Dillingen in Bavaria, and from there he went in\\n1752 to the University of Ingolstadt, where he studied phi-\\nlosophy , theology , music, and mathematics. Eventually he\\ndecided on a medical career . In 1759 he entered the Uni-\\nversity of Vienna, receiving a medical degree in 1766.\\nMesmer settled in Vienna and began to develop his\\nconcept of an invisible fluid in the body that affected\\nhealth. At first he used magnets to manipulate this fluid\\nbut gradually came to believe these were unnecessary;\\nthat, in fact, anything he touched became magnetized\\nand that a health-giving fluid emanated from his own\\nbody . Mesmer believed a rapport with his patients was\\nessential for cure and achieved it with diverse trappings.\\nHis treatment rooms were heavily draped, music was\\nplayed, and Mesmer appeared in long violet robes.\\nMesmer’ s methods were frowned upon by the med-\\nical establishment in Vienna, so in 1778 he moved to\\nP aris, hoping for a better reception for his ideas. In France\\nhe achieved overwhelming popularity except among the\\nphysicians. On the basis of medical opinion, repeated ef-\\nforts were made by the French government to discredit\\nMesmer . Mesmer retired to Switzerland at the beginning\\nof the French Revolution in 1789, where he spent the re-\\nmaining years of his life.\\nCritics focused attention of Mesmer’ s methods and\\ninsisted that cures existed only in the patient’ s mind. The\\nnineteenth-century studies of Mesmer’ s work by James\\nBraid and others in England demonstrated that the impor-\\ntant aspect of Mesmer’ s treatment was the patient’ s reac-\\ntion. Braid introduced the term “hypnotism” and insisted\\nthat hypnotic phenomena were essentially physiological\\nand not associated with a fluid. Still later studies in\\nFrance by A. A. Liebeault and Hippolyte Bernheim attrib-\\nuted hypnotic phenomena to psychological forces, par-\\nticularly suggestion. While undergoing this scientific\\ntransformation in the nineteenth century , mesmerism in\\nother quarters became more closely associated with oc-\\ncultism, spiritualism, and faith healing, providing in the\\nlast instance the basis for Christian Science.\\nDR.

A\\nstatement from the W orld Hypnosis Organization\\n(WHO) warns against performing hypnosis on patients\\nsuffering from psychosis, organic psychiatric condi-\\ntions, or antisocial personality disorders.

The Church of\\nJesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints approves it for medical\\npurposes, but cautions members against allowing them-\\nselves to be hypnotized for entertainment or demonstra-\\ntion purposes.\\nIn 1985, the AMA convened a commission that\\nwarned against using hypnotherapy to aid in recollection\\nof events.

Studies with children have shown responses\\nto hypnotherapy ranging from diminished pain and anxi-\\nety during a number of medical procedures; a 50% range\\nin reduction of symptoms or a complete resolution of a\\nmedical condition; and a reduction in use of antinausea\\nmedication and vomiting during chemotherapy for\\nchildhood cancers.\\nIn 2002, a report compiled several study results on\\nhypnosis.

It is very easy to learn how to hypnotize\\nsomeone, and the fact that hypnotism dates back to an-\\ncient times proves the ease with which a trance can be\\ninduced. There are no licensing procedures in place that\\nlimit the practice of hypnotherapy to medical profession-\\nals. Hypnotherapists are not regulated in any way; there\\nare no uniform education or certification requirements to\\nperform hypnotherapy .\\nThe National Board for Hypnotherapy and Hypnotic\\nAnaesthesiology (NBHA) has specific membership re-\\nquirements and also offers varying levels of professional\\nrecognition. Certification as a Clinical Hypnotherapist\\n(C.Ht.) requires a minimum of 200 hours of classroom\\ninstruction and, independent study and life learning ex-\\nperience in the medical, dental, psychological, or peer\\ncounseling professions. Certification as a Medical Hyp-\\nnotherapist (C.M.H.) requires meeting the standards for\\nthe Clinical Hypnotherapist level plus attending a resi-\\ndential training course or home study training course that\\nrequires a clinical practicum/internship approved by the\\nNBHA. Certification as a Hypno-Anesthesia Therapist\\n(Ct.H.A.) requires the successful completion of an\\nNBHA-approved course in V isualization and Guided\\nImagery for Pain Management, and a passing score on\\nthe examination. Certification as a Registered Hypnotic\\nAnaesthesiologist (R.H.A.) requires two years of contin-\\nuous membership in the NBHA at the Ct.H.A. level, and\\ncompletion of advanced training seminars. The highest\\nlevel of certification that can be obtained in this organi-\\nzation is Fellow (F .B.H.A.). Requirements for achieving\\nthis level of certification include membership at the\\nR.H.A. level and a graduate degree from an accredited\\nuniversity , plus submitting a comprehensive thesis.\\nThere is an ongoing debate regarding the issue of\\nclinically trained versus lay hypnotists. The position of\\nthe American Society of Clinical Hypnotists (ASCH) is\\nthat the training of lay hypnotists is unethical. This orga-\\nnization supports only the training of those persons who\\nare pursuing an advanced degree in the health sciences.\\nASCH further believes that hypnotherapy is a treatment\\nmodality to be used in conjunction with other forms of\\ntreatment, not a treatment that stands alone. Medical pro-\\nfessionals believe that lay hypnotists keep the view of\\nhypnotherapy in low esteem by the general public. They\\nalso believe that their practices are impacted economi-\\ncally by the lay hypnotists.\\nASCH and the Society for Clinical and Experimen-\\ntal Hypnosis (SCEH) are two organizations that are try-\\ning to set up formal screening, training, and accrediting\\nstandards. Both of these organizations offer formal train-\\ning to medical professionals at their annual meetings.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nElman, Dave. Hypnotherapy.

Odle\\nHypoglycemia\\nDefinition\\nThe condition called hypoglycemia is literally trans-\\nlated as low blood sugar. Hypoglycemia occurs when\\nblood sugar (or blood glucose) concentrations fall below\\na level necessary to properly support the body’s need for\\nenergy and stability throughout its cells.\\nDescription\\nCarbohydrates are the main dietary source of the\\nglucose that is manufactured in the liver and absorbed\\ninto the bloodstream to fuel the body’s cells and organs.\\nGlucose concentration is controlled by hormones, pri-\\nmarily insulin and glucagon. Glucose concentration is\\nalso controlled by epinephrine (adrenalin) and norepi-\\nnephrine, as well as growth hormone. If these regulators\\nare not working properly , levels of blood sugar can be-\\ncome either excessive (as in hyperglycemia) or inade-\\nquate (as in hypoglycemia). If a person has a blood sugar\\nlevel of 50 mg/dl or less, he or she is considered hypo-\\nglycemic, although glucose levels vary widely from one\\nperson to another.\\nHypoglycemia can occur in several ways.\\nDrug-induced hypoglycemia\\nDrug-induced hypoglycemia, a complication of dia-\\nbetes, is the most commonly seen and most dangerous\\nform of hypoglycemia.\\nHypoglycemia occurs most often in diabetics who\\nmust inject insulin periodically to lower their blood\\nsugar. While other diabetics are also vulnerable to low\\nblood sugar episodes, they have a lower risk of a serious\\noutcome than do insulin-dependent diabetics. Unless\\nrecognized and treated immediately , severe hypo-\\nglycemia in the insulin-dependent diabetic can lead to\\ngeneralized convulsions followed by amnesia and uncon-\\nsciousness. Death, though rare, is a possible outcome.\\nIn insulin-dependent diabetics, hypoglycemia\\nknown as an insulin reaction or insulin shock can be\\ncaused by several factors. These include overmedicating\\nwith manufactured insulin, missing or delaying a meal,\\neating too little food for the amount of insulin taken, ex-\\nercising too strenuously , drinking too much alcohol, or\\nany combination of these factors.\\nIdiopathic or reactive hypoglycemia\\nIdiopathic or reactive hypoglycemia (also called\\npostprandial hypoglycemia) occurs when some people\\neat. A number of reasons for this reaction have been pro-\\nposed, but no single cause has been identified.\\nIn some cases, this form of hypoglycemia appears to\\nbe associated with malfunctions or diseases of the liver, pi-\\ntuitary , adrenals, liver, or pancreas. These conditions are\\nunrelated to diabetes. Children intolerant of a natural sugar\\n(fructose) or who have inherited defects that affect diges-\\ntion may also experience hypoglycemic attacks. Some\\nchildren with a negative reaction to aspirin also experience\\nreactive hypoglycemia. It sometimes occurs among people\\nwith an intolerance to the sugar found in milk (galactose),\\nand it also often begins before the onset of diabetes.\\nFasting hypoglycemia\\nFasting hypoglycemia sometimes occurs after long\\nperiods without food, but it also happens occasionally\\nfollowing strenuous exercise , such as running in a\\nmarathon.\\nOther factors sometimes associated with hypo-\\nglycemia include:\\n• pregnancy\\n• a weakened immune system\\n• a poor diet high in simple carbohydrates\\n• prolonged use of drugs, including antibiotics\\n• chronic physical or mental stress\\n• heartbeat irregularities (arrhythmias)\\n• allergies\\n• breast cancer\\n• high blood pressure treated with beta-blocker medica-\\ntions (after strenuous exercise)\\n• upper gastrointestinal tract surgery\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1037\\nHypoglycemia\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1037'),\n",

Simultaneously , a combination of\\nchemicals that regulate how the body’s cells absorb that\\nsugar is released from the liver, pancreas, and adrenal\\nglands. These chemical regulators include insulin,\\nglucagon, epinephrine (adrenaline), and norepinephrine.\\nThe mixture of these regulators released following diges-\\ntion of carbohydrates is never the same, since the amount\\nof carbohydrates that are eaten is never the same.\\nInteractions among the regulators are complicated.\\nAny abnormalities in the effectiveness of any one of the\\nregulators can reduce or increase the body’s absorption\\nof glucose. Gastrointestinal enzymes such as amylase\\nand lactase that break down carbohydrates may not be\\nfunctioning properly . These abnormalities may produce\\nhyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, and can be detected\\nwhen the level of glucose in the blood is measured.\\nCell sensitivity to these regulators can be changed in\\nmany ways. Over time, a person’s stress level, exercise\\npatterns, advancing age, and dietary habits influence cel-\\nlular sensitivity . For example, a diet consistently overly\\nrich in carbohydrates increases insulin requirements over\\ntime. Eventually , cells can become less receptive to the\\neffects of the regulating chemicals, which can lead to\\nglucose intolerance.\\nDiet is both a major factor in producing hypo-\\nglycemia as well as the primary method for controlling\\nit. Diets typical of W estern cultures contain excess re-\\nfined carbohydrates, especially in the form of simple car-\\nbohydrates such as sweeteners, which are more easily\\nconverted to sugar. In poorer parts of the world, the typi-\\ncal diet contains even higher levels of carbohydrates.\\nFewer dairy products and meat are eaten, and grains,\\nvegetables, and fruits are consumed. This dietary trend is\\nbalanced, however, since people in these cultures eat\\nmore complex carbohydrates, eat smaller meals, and\\nusually use carbohydrates more efficiently through phys-\\nical labor.\\nEarly symptoms of severe hypoglycemia, particular-\\nly in the drug-induced type of hypoglycemia, resemble\\nan extreme shock reaction. Symptoms include:\\n• cold and pale skin\\n• numbness around the mouth\\n• apprehension\\n• heart palpitations\\n• emotional outbursts\\n• hand tremors\\n• mental cloudiness\\n• dilated pupils\\n• sweating\\n• fainting\\nMild attacks, however, are more common in reactive\\nhypoglycemia and are characterized by extreme tired-\\nness. Patients first lose their alertness, then their muscle\\nstrength and coordination. Thinking grows fuzzy , and fi-\\nnally the patient becomes so tired that he or she becomes\\n“zombie-like, ” awake but not functioning. Sometimes\\nthe patient will actually fall asleep. Unplanned naps are\\ntypical of the chronic hypoglycemic patient, particularly\\nfollowing meals.\\nAdditional symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia in-\\nclude headaches, double vision, staggering or an inabili-\\nty to walk, a craving for salt and/or sweets, abdominal\\ndistress, premenstrual tension, chronic colitis, allergies,\\nringing in the ears, unusual patterns in the frequency of\\nurination, skin eruptions and inflammations, pain in the\\nneck and shoulder muscles, memory problems, and sud-\\nden and excessive sweating.\\nUnfortunately , a number of these symptoms mimic\\nthose of other conditions. For example, the depression ,\\ninsomnia , irritability , lack of concentration, crying\\nspells, phobias , forgetfulness, confusion, unsocial be-\\nhavior, and suicidal tendencies commonly seen in ner-\\nvous system and psychiatric disorders may also be hypo-\\nglycemic symptoms. It is very important that anyone\\nwith symptoms that may suggest reactive hypoglycemia\\nsee a doctor.\\nBecause all of its possible symptoms are not likely to\\nbe seen in any one person at a specific time, diagnosing\\nhypoglycemia can be difficult.

Symptoms usually improve after the patient has\\ngone on an appropriate diet. Reactive hypoglycemia was\\ndiagnosed more frequently 10–20 years ago than today .\\nStudies have shown that most people suffering from its\\nsymptoms test normal for blood sugar, leading many doc-\\ntors to suggest that actual cases of reactive hypoglycemia\\nare quite rare. Some doctors think that people with hypo-\\nglycemic symptoms may be particularly sensitive to the\\nbody’s normal postmeal release of the hormone epineph-\\nrine, or are actually suffering from some other physical or\\nmental problem. Other doctors believe reactive hypo-\\nglycemia is actually the early onset of diabetes that oc-\\ncurs after a number of years. There continues to be dis-\\nagreement about the cause of reactive hypoglycemia.\\nA common test to diagnose hypoglycemia is the ex-\\ntended oral glucose tolerance test. Following an\\novernight fast, a concentrated solution of glucose is\\ndrunk and blood samples are taken hourly for five to six\\nhours. Though this test remains helpful in early identifi-\\ncation of diabetes, its use in diagnosing chronic reactive\\nhypoglycemia has lost favor because it can trigger hypo-\\nglycemic symptoms in people with otherwise normal\\nglucose readings. Some doctors now recommend that\\nblood sugar be tested at the actual time a person experi-\\nences hypoglycemic symptoms.\\nT reatment\\nTreatment of the immediate symptoms of hypo-\\nglycemia can include eating sugar. For example, a pa-\\ntient can eat a piece of candy , drink milk, or drink fruit\\njuice. Glucose tablets can be used by patients, especially\\nthose who are diabetic. Effective treatment of hypo-\\nglycemia over time requires the patient to follow a modi-\\nfied diet. Patients are usually encouraged to eat small but\\nfrequent meals throughout the day and, avoid excess\\nsimple sugars (including alcohol), fats, and fruit drinks.\\nOne of the herbal remedies commonly suggested for\\nhypoglycemia is a decoction (an extract made by boiling)\\nof gentian ( Gentiana lutea ). It should be drunk warm\\n15–30 minutes before a meal. Gentian is believed to help\\nstimulate the endocrine (hormone-producing) glands.\\nIn addition to the dietary modifications recommend-\\ned above, people with hypoglycemia may benefit from\\nsupplementing their diet with chromium , which is be-\\nlieved to help improve blood sugar levels. Chromium is\\nfound in whole-grain breads and cereals, cheese, mo-\\nlasses, lean meats, and brewer’s yeast . Eating oats can\\nhelp stabilize blood sugar levels. Daily supplements of\\nvitamin E are also recommended. People with hypo-\\nglycemia should avoid alcohol, caffeine , and cigarette\\nsmoke, since these substances can cause significant\\nswings in blood sugar levels.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThose patients with severe hypoglycemia may re-\\nquire fast-acting glucagon injections that can stabilize\\ntheir blood sugar within approximately 15 minutes.\\nPrevention\\nDrug-induced hypoglycemia\\nPreventing hypoglycemic insulin reactions in dia-\\nbetics requires taking glucose readings through frequent\\nblood sampling. Insulin can then be regulated based on\\nthose readings. Maintaining proper diet is also a factor.\\nProgrammable insulin pumps implanted under the skin\\nhave proven useful in reducing the incidence of hypo-\\nglycemic episodes for insulin-dependent diabetics. In\\nearly 2002, scientists announced that a new therapy in-\\nvolving a synthetic insulin called insulin glargine in\\ncombination with one of several other short-acting in-\\nsulins could provide a new alternative for diabetics at\\nrisk for hypoglycemia. The synthetic insulin combina-\\ntion acted safely in all patients, including children, and\\ndid not cause hypoglycemia like rapid-acting insulins.\\nReactive hypoglycemia\\nThe onset of reactive hypoglycemia can be avoided\\nor at least delayed by following the same kind of diet\\nused to control it. While not as restrictive as the diet dia-\\nbetics must follow to keep tight control over their dis-\\nease, it is quite similar.\\nThere are a variety of diet recommendations for the\\nreactive hypoglycemic. Patients should:\\n• A void overeating.\\n• Never skip breakfast.\\n• Include protein in all meals and snacks, preferably\\nfrom sources low in fat, such as the white meat of\\nchicken or turkey , most fish, soy products, or skim\\nmilk.\\n• Restrict intake of fats (particularly saturated fats, such\\nas animal fats), and avoid refined sugars and processed\\nfoods.\\n• Keep a “food diary . ” Until the diet is stabilized, a pa-\\ntient should note what and how much he/she eats and\\ndrinks at every meal.

Because T 4\\nregulates such essential functions as heart rate, digestion,\\nphysical growth, and mental development, an insuffi-\\nciency of this hormone can slow life-sustaining process-\\nes, damage organs and tissues in every part of the body ,\\nand lead to life-threatening complications.\\nDescription\\nHypothyroidism is one of the most common chronic\\ndiseases in the United States. Symptoms may not appear\\nuntil years after the thyroid has stopped functioning, and\\nthey are often mistaken for signs of other illnesses,\\nmenopause , or aging . Although this condition is be-\\nlieved to affect as many as 11 million adults and chil-\\ndren, as many as two of every three people with hy-\\npothyroidism may not know they have the disease.\\nThe thyroid gland influences almost every organ, tis-\\nsue, and cell in the body . It is shaped like a butterfly and\\nlocated just below the Adam’s apple. The thyroid stores\\niodine the body gets from food and uses this mineral to\\ncreate T\\n4 and T3. Low T4 levels can alter weight, appetite,\\nsleep patterns, body temperature, sex drive, and a variety\\nof other physical, mental, and emotional characteristics.\\nThere are three types of hypothyroidism. The most\\ncommon is primary hypothyroidism, in which the thy-\\nroid doesn’t produce an adequate amount of T\\n4. Sec-\\nondary hypothyroidism develops when the pituitary\\ngland does not release enough of the thyroid-stimulating\\nhormone (TSH) that prompts the thyroid to manufacture\\nT\\n4.

Drug-induced hypothyroidism, an\\nadverse reaction to medication, occurs in two of every\\n10,000 people, but rarely causes severe hypothyroidism.\\nHypothyroidism is at least twice as common in\\nwomen as it is in men. Although hypothyroidism is most\\ncommon in women who are middle-aged or older, the\\ndisease can occur at any age. Newborn infants are tested\\nfor congenital (acquired in utero (Latin)) thyroid defi-\\nciency (cretinism) using a test that measures the levels of\\nthyroxine and TSH in the infant’s blood. Treatment with-\\nin the first few months of life can prevent mental retarda-\\ntion and physical abnormalities. Older children who de-\\nvelop hypothyroidism suddenly stop growing.\\nFactors that increase a person’s risk of developing\\nhypothyroidism include age, weight, and medical histo-\\nry . W omen are more likely to develop the disease after\\nage 50; men, after age 60. Obesity (excessively fat con-\\ndition) also increases the risk. A family history of thy-\\nroid problems or a personal history of high cholesterol\\nlevels or such autoimmune diseases as lupus, rheuma-\\ntoid arthritis , or diabetes can make an individual more\\nsusceptible to hypothyroidism.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nHypothyroidism is most often the result of\\nHashimoto’s disease, also known as chronic thyroiditis\\n(inflammation of the thyroid gland). In this disease, the\\nimmune system fails to recognize that the thyroid gland\\nis part of the body’s own tissue and attacks it as if it were\\na foreign body . The attack by the immune system im-\\npairs thyroid function and sometimes destroys the gland.\\nOther causes of hypothyroidism include:\\n• Radiation (the process whereby an element like radium\\nemits rays). Radioactive (the quality some atoms have\\nof producing energy) iodine used to treat hyperthy-\\nroidism (overactive thyroid) or radiation treatments for\\nhead or neck cancers can destroy the thyroid gland.\\n• Surgery . Removal of the thyroid gland because of can-\\ncer or other thyroid disorders can result in hypothy-\\nroidism.\\n• V iruses (very small organisms that cause disease)and bac-\\nteria (very small one-cell organisms that divide and can\\ncause disease). Infections that depress thyroid hormone\\nproduction usually cause permanent hypothyroidism.\\n• Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Among virus-\\nes, HIV , the virus that causes acquired immunodefi-\\nciency syndrome, or AIDS, may cause overt hypothy-\\nroidism. A 2004 report said that hypothyroidism occurs\\nmore often in HIV -infected patients taking highly ac-\\ntive antiretroviral therapy (HAAR T).\\n• Medications. Nitroprusside, lithium, or iodides can in-\\nduce hypothyroidism. Because patients who use these\\nmedications are closely monitored by their doctors, this\\nside effect is very rare.\\n• Pituitary gland malfunction. This is a rare condition in\\nwhich the pituitary gland fails to produce enough TSH\\nto activate the thyroid’s production of T\\n4.\\n• Congenital defect. One of every 4,000 babies is born\\nwithout a properly functioning thyroid gland.\\n• Diet. Because the thyroid makes T 4 from iodine drawn\\nfrom food, an iodine-deficient diet can cause hypothy-\\nroidism. Adding iodine to table salt and other common\\nfoods has eliminated iodine deficiency in the United\\nStates. Certain foods (cabbage, rutabagas, peanuts,\\npeaches, soybeans, spinach) can interfere with thyroid\\nhormone production.\\n• Environmental contaminants. Certain industrial chemi-\\ncals, such as PCBs, found in the local environment at\\nhigh levels may also cause hypothyroidism.\\nHypothyroidism sometimes is referred to as a “silent”\\ndisease because early symptoms may be so mild that no\\none realizes anything is wrong.

When\\nthe disease results from surgery or other treatment for\\nhyperthyroidism, symptoms may appear suddenly and\\ninclude severe muscle cramps in the arms, legs, neck,\\nshoulders, and back. It’s important to see a doctor if any\\nof these symptoms appear unexpectedly . When hypothy-\\nroidism remains undiagnosed and untreated, a person\\nmay eventually develop myxedema. Symptoms of this\\nrare but potentially deadly complication include enlarged\\ntongue, swollen facial features, hoarseness, and physical\\nand mental sluggishness.\\nMyxedema coma is characterized by unresponsive-\\nness, irregular and shallow breathing, and a drop in\\nblood pressure and body temperature. The onset of this\\nmedical emergency can be sudden in people who are el-\\nderly or have been ill, injured, or exposed to very cold\\ntemperatures; who have recently had surgery; or who use\\nsedatives or antidepressants. Without immediate medical\\nattention, myxedema coma can be fatal.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of hypothyroidism is based on the pa-\\ntient’s observations, medical history , physical examina-\\ntion, and thyroid function tests. Doctors who specialize in\\ntreating thyroid disorders (endocrinologists) are most apt\\nto recognize subtle symptoms and physical indications of\\nhypothyroidism. A blood test known as a thyroid-stimu-\\nlating hormone (TSH) assay , tests of T\\n4 and T3 levels, a\\nthyroid nuclear medicine scan, and thyroid ultrasound are\\nused to confirm the diagnosis. A woman being tested for\\nhypothyroidism should let her doctor know if she is preg-\\nnant or breastfeeding. All patients should be sure their\\ndoctors are aware of any recent procedures involving ra-\\ndioactive materials or contrast media.\\nThe TSH assay is extremely accurate, but some doc-\\ntors doubt the test’s ability to detect mild hypothyroidism.\\nThey advise patients to monitor their basal (resting) body\\ntemperature for below-normal readings that could indi-\\ncate the presence of hypothyroidism. These readings\\nshould be taken for five consecutive days, starting on the\\nsecond day of the menstrual cycle for female patients.\\nThe normal temperature reading is 97.5°F (36.4°C).\\nT reatment\\nAlternative treatments are aimed primarily at\\nstrengthening the thyroid gland and will not eliminate\\nthe need for thyroid hormone medications. They include\\nnutritional therapy , herbal therapy , and exercise.\\nNutritional therapy\\nIf a person is experiencing symptoms resembling\\nthose of hypothyroidism, it is best to talk to a family\\nphysician immediately for appropriate diagnosis and\\ntreatments. Nutritional therapy should only be comple-\\nmentary and not used to replace conventional treatment\\nfor this disorder. In 2004, a study found that feeding soy\\nformula to infants with congenital hypothyroidism led to\\nprolonged increases in TSH levels. The study authors rec-\\nommended close follow-up and frequent TSH measures if\\ninfants are put on soy-based formulas.\\nA naturopath or a nutritionist may recommend the fol-\\nlowing dietary changes to improve mild hypothyroidism:\\n• A voiding eating the following raw foods: cabbage,\\nmustard, spinach, cassava roots, peanuts, soybeans, and\\npeaches. They may interfere with thyroid hormone pro-\\nduction if not cooked.\\n• Eating foods with high iodine content such as fish,\\nshellfish, and seaweed.\\n• T aking multivitamin and mineral supplements daily .\\nVitamins A, B\\n2, B3, B6, E, and zinc are needed for nor-\\nmal thyroid hormone production.\\n• Strengthening thyroid function with thyroid prepara-\\ntions sold at local food stores. They are used to treat\\nmild hypothyroidism only . A vailable products include\\nthyroid extracts, iodine, zinc, or tyrosine. Most Ameri-\\ncans may not need iodine supplements, as the daily re-\\nquirement can easily be met by eating iodine-rich foods\\nor using iodized salt.

Odle\\nHyssop\\nDescription\\nHyssop ( Hyssopus officinalis ) is a member of the\\nLamiaceae or mint family . This aromatic evergreen, clas-\\nsified by botanists as a sub-shrub, should not be con-\\nfused with several distinct species of plants also called\\nhyssop, including giant hyssop, hedge hyssop, prairie\\nhyssop, or wild hyssop. Hyssop is native to southern Eu-\\nrope and Asia. The London surgeon and apothecary John\\nGerard, author of the Herball or Generall Historie of\\nPlantes, brought hyssop to England in 1597. The attrac-\\ntive herb soon became a component in many ornamental\\nknot gardens. The sun-loving hyssop has naturalized\\nthroughout North America, and grows wild in chalky soil\\nand on dry and rocky slopes in the Mediterranean.\\nHyssop has a short and fibrous rhizome. The stalk\\nemerges from a woody base and divides into numerous\\nerect, square, and branching stems that may reach a\\nheight of 2 ft (61 cm). The small leaves are opposite,\\nwithout stems, and lance-shaped, with fine hairs and\\nsmooth margins. They have a somewhat bitter taste.\\nFlowers have a tubular, two-lipped corolla, and four sta-\\nmens. They bloom in successive whorls in the leaf axils\\nat the top of the stems, only growing along one side. The\\nblooms may be in shades of rose, purple, mauve, blue,\\nand sometimes white, depending on the variety . Hyssop\\ncomes into flower from June through October, and the\\nblossoms are well loved by bees. The perennial hyssop is\\na sweet and warming aromatic with a camphor-like\\nscent. This garden favorite is especially useful in com-\\npanion planting. Hyssop attracts the white butterfly , a\\npest to cabbage and broccoli, thus sparing the food crops\\nfrom the infestation. The herb also has been used to in-\\ncrease the yield of grapevines and the flavor of the fruit\\nwhen it is planted nearby .\\nThe Hebrew people called this herb azob, meaning\\n“holy herb. ” Hyssop was used in ancient times as a\\ncleansing herb for temples and other sacred places. It\\nwas also used to repel insects. The Romans used hyssop\\nto bring protection from the plague and prepared an\\nherbal wine containing hyssop. In ancient Greece, the\\nphysicians Galen and Hippocrates valued hyssop for in-\\nflammations of the throat and chest, pleurisy , and other\\nbronchial complaints. In the early seventeenth and eigh-\\nteenth centuries, hyssop tea and tincture were used to\\ntreat jaundice and dropsy .\\nGeneral use\\nThe flowers and leaves of hyssop are considered med-\\nicinally valuable by some herbalists; however, the German\\nCommission E has not approved hyssop for any medicinal\\npurposes. The herb has some antimicrobial and antiviral\\nproperties. It is especially useful in helping the immune\\nsystem to combat respiratory infections and colds. Hyssop\\ntaken in a warm infusion acts as an expectorant and will\\nhelp to expel phlegm and break up congestion in the lungs.\\nIt is frequently recommended for the treatment of congest-\\ned sinuses and catarrh. It is also a beneficial herb for treat-\\nment of the cold sore virus, Herpes simplex. An infusion\\nhas also been used to relieve the distress of asthma. Hys-\\nsop is a diaphoretic which means that it acts to promote\\nperspiration. It will help to reduce fever and eliminate tox-\\nins through the skin. Hyssop also acts as a carminative and\\ndigestive aid, relieving flatulence and relaxing the digestive\\nsystem. This versatile herb is also a nervine, which means\\nthat it calms anxiety . It is useful in children’s digestive and\\nrespiratory herbal formulas, as well.\\nUsed externally as a skin wash, a decoction of the\\nflowering tops can help the healing of burns and relieve\\nskin inflammations. The fresh crushed leaves promote\\nhealing of bruises, and relieve the discomfort of insect\\nbites and stings. When applied as a hair rinse, hyssop\\nmay help eliminate head lice.

The lichen is a bitter-tasting\\nplant that is said to smell like seaweed when it is wet.\\nDespite these unappetizing characteristics, Iceland moss\\nhas long been used in Scandinavia and Europe as a food\\nsource and a remedy for numerous conditions.\\nHistoric uses of Iceland moss\\nPeople in countries including Iceland, Sweden, Nor-\\nway , Finland, and Russia have used Iceland moss for\\nfood and medicine. When used for nourishment, the Ice-\\nland moss was ground into flour, which was used to bake\\nbread. Boiling the plant was said to remove the bitter\\ntaste, so the plant was boiled and made into a jelly . The\\nlichen became part of a gelled dessert with ingredients\\nthat could include chocolate, almonds, or lemon.\\nIn addition, Iceland moss was boiled in milk, a bev-\\nerage served as a remedy for such conditions as malnu-\\ntrition. The milk-and-lichen beverage was served to sick\\npeople, frail children, and the aged. It was also used for\\nserious conditions when the person was vomiting.\\nIceland moss also had numerous folk medicine uses.\\nThe lichen was a folk remedy for tuberculosis, lung dis-\\nease, chest ailments, and problems with the kidney and\\nbladder. Iceland moss was also used to treat wounds that\\ndid not heal, diarrhea , problems with lactation, fevers,\\nand gastritis.\\nFurthermore, people in Norway ate Iceland moss\\nduring a seven-year famine that started in 1807. The\\nRussians found another use for the lichen during W orld\\nW ar II, when they prepared a version of molasses with\\nIceland moss.\\nContemporary uses of Iceland moss\\nThe acids in Iceland moss have an antibiotic effect.\\nIt is a mild antimicrobial and a demulcent—a remedy\\nthat soothes irritated or inflamed mucous membranes.\\nThe lichen is used to treat inflammation of the mouth\\nand pharynx, and for treatment of the common cold ,\\nfever, dry cough, and bronchitis. It is also used for peo-\\nple who have a tendency toward infection. Furthermore,\\nthe bitter herb is a remedy for digestive complaints, loss\\nof appetite, and gastroenteritis . Iceland moss boiled in\\nmilk is still used as a tonic beverage for people recover-\\ning from illnesses. In addition, the lichen has been used\\nto treat diabetes.\\nPreparations\\nIn Europe, Iceland moss cough drops are sold in phar-\\nmacies. The lichen is also sold in other forms for a range of\\nconditions.

The tree belongs to the Logani-\\naceae family , and has long, twining, smooth branches.\\nOn the branches grows a fruit that is the size and shape\\nof a pear. Inside the fruit are almond-shaped seeds, or\\nbeans, that have a fine, downy covering and are blackish\\ngray or clear brown in color.\\nThe Latin name is Ignatius amara , amara being the\\nLatin work for bitter. The bean was named after St. Ig-\\nnatius Loyola, a Spanish Jesuit who was responsible for\\nbringing the beans to Europe from the Philippines in the\\nseventeenth century . As a result, the beans are often\\ncalled St. Ignatius beans. The missionaries were intro-\\nduced to the beans by the locals, who wore the beans as\\namulets to prevent disease. The bean was then used as a\\ntreatment for gout, epilepsy, cholera, and asthma.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21048\\nIgnatia\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nDecoction —A method for releasing the herbal\\nessence of bark or roots that includes simmering\\nin water .\\nInfusion —A method for releasing the herbal\\nessence of leaves and flowers in which the herbs\\nare steeped in boiled water .\\nTincture —A method of preserving herbs with al-\\ncohol or water .\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1048'),\n",

Homeopaths frequently recommend ignatia\\nwhen the patient is suffering from romantic disappoint-\\nment or the loss of a spouse, relative, friend, or pet. The\\nremedy helps the patient bear the grief and suffering\\ncommon to emotional upsets.\\nSuppression of the emotions is the general cause of\\nignatia complaints. Men and women of all ages may\\nbenefit from Ignatia when they are grieving, but Ignatia\\nis particularly well suited for sensitive, delicate women\\nand children. It is recommended for children who devel-\\nop ailments after being punished, teenagers who are suf-\\nfering from a lost love, women who have had a miscar-\\nriage, and elderly folk who grieve silently . Ignatia is a\\ngood remedy for children who suffer from extreme trem-\\nbling after a fright. Ignatia is frequently prescribed in\\ncases of physical or sexual abuse. W omen who suffer\\nfrom nervousness, confusion, or forgetfulness during\\ntheir menstrual cycles may also benefit from Ignatia.\\nPersons who require the interaction of Ignatia are\\nidealistic, introspective, moody , quarrelsome, sensitive\\nto pain, timid, easily startled, weepy , and depressed. As\\na result of their grief they become fearful, apprehensive,\\nand antisocial. They dislike consolation and desire to be\\nalone. When in the company of others they are secretive\\nand try to hold in their emotions, although they sigh fre-\\nquently and loudly . When alone, they are prone to fre-\\nquent bouts of sobbing alternating with nervous laughter.\\nThey are conscientious about performing tasks correctly .\\nIgnatia is a remedy of contradictions. It is used to\\ntreat symptoms that are often paradoxical and erratic.\\nFor example, symptoms of nausea are relieved by eat-\\ning, a sore throat is better from swallowing solids, and\\nsimple foods are harder to digest than heavier foods.\\nSymptoms may be relieved after passing a hard stool.\\nLying on the painful side may make the symptoms bet-\\nter. Eating causes the patient to have more hunger. She\\nmay crave sour or hard to digest foods. She may also\\nwant to remain uncovered when cold. The patient dis-\\nlikes fresh air and is sensitive to coffee and tobacco.\\nGeneral symptoms are aggravated by cold air, emo-\\ntional excitement, mental exertion, sweets, and consolation.\\nThey are worse in the morning, evening, night, and before\\nand during menstruation. Symptoms may appear at regu-\\nlar intervals, such as headaches that occur every seven days.\\nSymptoms are improved by warmth and eating.\\nIgnatia is also used as a remedy for headaches, sore\\nthroat, trembling, nervousness, insomnia , heart palpita-\\ntions, gas, indigestion , weakness, and weeping. Other\\nconditions include irritable bowel syndrome , painful\\nhemorrhoids, or a dry , tickling cough.\\nThe cough is a dry , irritating cough that is often ac-\\ncompanied by a stitching pain in the chest. Suppression\\nof the cough is helpful. The patient is made worse by\\ncoughing or lying in bed, and the cough is worse in the\\nevening. Ignatia is often used in the treatment of whoop-\\ning cough or croup.\\nThe fever is often accompanied by extreme thirst\\nand chills. The patient feels better when uncovered, and\\nis worse in the afternoon.\\nHeadaches typical of Ignatia start gradually and stop\\nsuddenly . The pain is gathered in the forehead. The pa-\\ntient may complain of a sensation as if a nail were being\\ndriven through her head. Headaches are often caused by\\nemotional upset and are worse in a smoky room.\\nA sore throat accompanied by stitching pains and a\\nsensation as if there were a lump in the throat is often\\npresent as a result of suppressed emotions. The throat is\\nworse in the evening and is better from swallowing.\\nWhen indigestion is present, the patient may feel as\\nthough her stomach were empty . She may suffer from\\nsour-tasting belches that ameliorate her symptoms.\\nPreparations\\nIgnatia is prepared by grinding the bean into a pow-\\nder and steeping the powder in alcohol. The mixture is\\nstrained and diluted until it becomes a non-toxic sub-\\nstance. It is then succussed to create the final preparation.\\nDuring an emotional crisis, take a single dose of\\n30X or 30C. If the symptoms are unchanged after eight\\nhours, try another remedy . If the dose helps, repeat the\\ndose only when the symptoms worsen. Do not take more\\nthan two times a day for three days.\\nPrecautions\\nIf symptoms do not improve after the recommended\\ntime period, consult your homeopath or health-care prac-\\ntitioner.\\nDo not exceed the recommended dose.\\nIgnatia may cause insomnia and should be taken in\\nthe morning.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1049\\nIgnatia\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1049'),\n",

After earning his doctorate in\\nexperimental zoology in 1955 from New Y ork University ,\\nBurton moved to the California Institute of T echnology\\n(Caltech) as a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of H.\\nK. Mitchell. There, he and his coworkers discovered a\\ntumor-inducing factor (TIF) in fruit flies. A few years\\nlater, Burton and his colleague, Dr. Frank Friedman,\\njoined the cancer research staff of Dr. Antonio Rottino at\\nSt. V incent’s Hospital in New Y ork City . Rottino was one\\nof the first scientists to conclude that there was a connec-\\ntion between the body’s immune system and cancer.\\nBurton and the development of IAT\\nAfter Burton and his colleagues reported finding an\\ninhibitor of fruit-fly TIF in mice and human tissue,\\nMitchell published a retraction of the papers he had\\ncoauthored with Burton. Mitchell claimed that Burton’s\\nassay for TIF—on which Burton was basing his recent\\nwork—could not be repeated independently . Undeterred,\\nBurton continued using fruit flies and mice to develop a\\nmixture of blood proteins to slow or stop the prolifera-\\ntion of cancer cells.\\nBy the mid-1960s, Burton was making sensational\\npresentations. In 1966, at an American Cancer Society\\n(ACS) seminar for science writers, Burton injected mice\\nwith his “unblocking factor. ” Their tumors shrunk in less\\nthan an hour. Although newspaper headlines read “15-\\nMinute Cancer Cure, ” the medical community was un-\\nconvinced. Professional journals refused to publish Bur-\\nton’s papers and he eventually lost his research funding.\\nThe American Cancer Society (ACS) placed Burton’s\\nIA T on its list of unproven methods.\\nIn 1973, Burton and Friedman left St. V incent’s and,\\nwith independent funding, founded the Immunology Re-\\nsearching Foundation in Great Neck, New Y ork. They\\nbegan treating cancer patients with IA T . The following\\nyear they submitted an investigational new drug applica-\\ntion to the United States Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) in order to begin clinical trials of IA T . However,\\nwhen FDA officials asked Burton for his experimental\\nevidence, he withdrew his application.\\nBurton and Friedman eventually patented four sub-\\nstances that they claimed to have isolated from human\\nblood:\\n• deblocking protein\\n• tumor antibody 1\\n• tumor antibody 2\\n• tumor complement\\nBurton claimed that when used in the correct combi-\\nnation, these substances restored normal immune func-\\ntion in cancer patients.\\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, the National\\nCancer Institute (NCI) tried to evaluate IA T .

With private\\nfunding, he founded the Immunology Researching Centre\\n(IRC), Ltd. in Freeport on Grand Bahama Island. This\\nnot-for-profit organization was licensed to treat people\\nwho had been diagnosed with cancer . In 1978, represen-\\ntatives from the Bahamian Ministry of Health and the Pan\\nAmerican Health Organization found violations in admis-\\nsions, treatment, and evaluation of the clinic’s patients.\\nThey could not determine the blood components used in\\nIA T , and found no records of patient survival rates. They\\nconcluded that there was no evidence that IA T was effec-\\ntive, and recommended that the facility be closed.\\nHowever, the Bahamian health authority did not\\nclose the clinic until 1985. At that time it was announced\\nthat blood supplies across the United States were conta-\\nminated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\\nBurton’s clinic was no exception. Indeed the clinic had\\ntreated Kaposi’s sarcoma in patients with acquired im-\\nmune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ). Although no HIV\\ninfections were ever traced to the clinic, and some scien-\\ntists questioned the HIV screening used by the authori-\\nties, the sera used in IA T were found to carry hepatitis\\nvirus and infectious bacteria. At least two cases of he-\\npatitis were traced to the sera. The Bahamian govern-\\nment, at the apparent insistence of the FDA and the NCI,\\nclosed the clinic for seven months, until screening and\\nsterilization methods for serum production were im-\\nproved. IA T had been legalized in Florida and Oklahoma\\nin the early 1980s; however, Florida rescinded its law\\nwhen the clinic closed. In 1986, the FDA banned the im-\\nport of IA T drugs.\\nThe closing of Burton’s clinic and the ban on sera\\nimport enraged many patients and their families. They\\nformed the Immuno-Augmentative Therapy Patient As-\\nsociation (IA TP A), later renamed People Against Cancer,\\nand began lobbying the United States Congress. In 1986,\\nthe Office of T echnology Assessment (OT A), then a re-\\nsearch branch of Congress, was told to investigate alter-\\nnative cancer therapies. OT A worked with Burton to de-\\nvelop procedures for an IA T clinical trial on colon cancer\\npatients. However the arrangement broke down, and the\\nOT A concluded that there was no reliable data with\\nwhich to evaluate IA T .\\nDuring the 1990s, the IRC opened additional clinics\\nin Germany and Mexico. Burton died in 1993 and his\\nlong-time associate, Dr. R. John Clement, took over IRC\\noperations. In 2003, Clement founded the ITL Cancer\\nClinic, a new operating company for the IRC. This new ,\\nexpanded clinic offered additional mainstream and alter-\\nnative treatments combined with IA T .\\nBenefits\\nAs of 2004, no one claims that IA T cures cancer.\\nProponents claim that the therapy can stop the spread of\\nmany cancers and may send the cancer into remission.\\nThey claim that by treating deficiencies or imbalances in\\nthe immune system, the body is able treat itself, resulting\\nin an extended lifespan and enhanced quality of life.\\nSometimes the disease has spread too far within the body\\nto respond to IA T . Furthermore, if chemotherapy or radi-\\nation treatment has over-suppressed the immune system,\\nresponse to IA T may be slow .\\nIA T is claimed to have about a 19% effectiveness\\nrate. V arious cancers respond differently to IA T:\\n• Bladder cancer responds favorably .\\n• Brain cancer: astrocytomas (noncapsulated brain tu-\\nmors arising in brain cells called astrocytes), grades I\\nand II, respond favorably; grade III does not respond\\nwell; glioblastoma multiforme (the fastest-growing\\ntype of brain tumor) is not a candidate for IA T .\\n• Breast cancer: all types respond, although inflammato-\\nry cancers respond poorly .\\n• Cervical cancer: responds in early stages; mixed results\\nin late stages.\\n• Colorectal cancer: good response in most stages;\\nmetastasis to the liver disqualifies it for IA T .\\n• Head and neck cancers respond favorably .\\n• Leukemias: adult chronic types respond to IA T .\\n• Lung cancers: adeno- and squamous-cell (large-cell)\\ncancers and mesotheliomas respond well to IA T; small-\\ncell, oat-cell, and undifferentiated cancers are not can-\\ndidates for IA T .\\n• Lymphoma: responses vary .\\n• Melanomas: extremely variable responses.\\n• Myeloma responds well, even at late stages.\\n• Pancreatic cancer: good response in some cases, al-\\nthough IA T may be inappropriate because of disease\\ncomplications.\\n• Prostate cancer responds at all stages.\\n• Skin metastases do not respond to IA T .\\nDescription\\nBoth conventional cancer immunotherapy and IA T\\nare based on enhancement of the immune system.

During the initial treatment, blood\\nfactors are measured once or twice per day , five days per\\nweek. In addition to measuring the serum factors used in\\ntreatment, the blood is analyzed for blocking protein fac-\\ntor (BPF). High levels of BPF and low levels of DPF and\\nTCF are claimed to cause immunosuppression or im-\\nmunodeficiency , enabling the cancer to grow and spread.\\nBased on this data, a computer calculates the amount of\\neach serum to be injected into the patient.\\nTreatment varies from one to 12 daily injections.\\nTreatment is on an outpatient basis for an average of\\n10–12 weeks.

It primarily afflicts children and the elderly . Ecthy-\\nma is a more severe form of impetigo with sores affect-\\ning a deeper layer of the skin. It often leaves scarring and\\ndiscoloration of the skin.\\nDescription\\nThe first sign of impetigo is a clear, fluid-filled\\nbump, called a vesicle, which appears on the skin. The\\nvesicle soon dries out and develops a scab-like, honey-\\ncolored crust, which breaks open and leaks fluid. These\\nvesicles usually appear grouped closely together, and\\nthey may spread out and cover a large area of the skin.\\nImpetigo often affects the area around the nose and\\nmouth; however, it can spread to anywhere on the skin,\\nbut especially the arms and legs, as well as the diaper\\nareas of infants. The condition called ecthyma is a form\\nof impetigo in which the sores that develop are larger,\\nfilled with pus, and covered with brownish-black scabs\\nthat may lead to scarring. Impetigo infections most com-\\nmonly occur during warmer weather.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nImpetigo is most frequently caused by the bacteria\\nStaphylococcus aureus, also known as “staph, ” and less\\nfrequently , by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, also\\nknown as “strep. ” These bacteria are highly contagious.\\nImpetigo can quickly spread from one part of the body to\\nanother through scratching. It can also be spread to other\\npeople if they touch the infected sores or if they have con-\\ntact with the soiled clothing, diapers, bed sheets, or toys of\\nan infected person. Such factors as heat, humidity , crowd-\\ned conditions, and poor hygiene increase the chance that\\nimpetigo will spread rapidly among large groups.\\nImpetigo tends to develop in areas of the skin that\\nhave already been damaged through some other means\\nsuch as injury , insect bite, sunburn,diaper rash, chicken\\npox, or herpes, especially oral herpes. The sores tend to\\nbe very itchy , and scratching may lead to the spread of\\nthe disease. Keeping the hands washed with antibacterial\\nsoap and fingernails well trimmed are good precautions\\nfor limiting further infection.\\nDiagnosis\\nObservation of the appearance, location and pattern\\nof sores is the usual method of diagnosis. Fluid from the\\nvesicles can be cultured and examined to identify the\\ncausative bacteria.\\nT reatment\\nEchinacea tincture can be applied directly to the\\nskin. The homeopathic remedy Antimonium tartaricum\\ncan be used when impetigo affects the face.\\nBag Balm, an anti-bacterial salve, can be applied to\\nsores to relieve pain and heal the skin.\\nA tincture of the pansy flower, V iola tricolor ,can be\\ntaken internally twice daily for a week to speed healing.\\nBurdock root oil can be directly applied to the skin\\nto help it heal.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21054\\nImpetigo\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1054'),\n",

The nerve endings in the\\npenis release chemical messengers, called neurotransmit-\\nters, that signal the arteries that supply blood to the corpora\\ncavernosa (the two spongy rods of tissue that span the\\nlength of the penis) to relax and fill with blood. As they ex-\\npand, the corpora cavernosa close off other veins that\\nwould normally drain blood from the penis. As the penis\\nbecomes engorged with blood, it enlarges and stiffens,\\ncausing an erection. Problems with blood vessels, nerves,\\nor tissues of the penis can interfere with an erection.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nIt is estimated that as many as 20 million American\\nmen frequently suffer from impotence and that it strikes\\nup to half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70.\\nDoctors used to think that most cases of impotence were\\npsychological in origin, but they now recognize that, at\\nleast in older men, physical causes may play a primary\\nrole in 60% or more of all cases. In men over the age of\\n60, the leading cause is atherosclerosis, or narrowing of\\nthe arteries, which can restrict the flow of blood to the\\npenis. Injury or disease of the connective tissue, such as\\nPeyronie’s disease, may prevent the corpora cavernosa\\nfrom completely expanding. Damage to the nerves of the\\npenis from certain types of surgery or neurological con-\\nditions, such as Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclero-\\nsis, may also cause impotence. Men with diabetes are es-\\npecially at risk for impotence because of their high risk\\nof both atherosclerosis and a nerve disease called diabet-\\nic neuropathy .\\nT opical washes with goldenseal , grapefruit seed\\nextract (which may sting), or tea tree oil are also recom-\\nmended.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nUncomplicated impetigo is usually treated with a\\ntopical antibiotic cream such as mupirocin (Bactroban).\\nOral antibiotics are also commonly prescribed. Patients\\nare advised to wash the affected areas with an antibacter-\\nial soap and water several times per day , and to other-\\nwise keep the skin dry . Scratching is discouraged, and\\nthe suggestion is that nails be cut or that mittens be\\nworn—especiallly with young children. Ecthyma is\\ntreated in the same manner, but at times may require sur-\\ngical debridement, or removal of the affected area.\\nExpected results\\nThe vast majority of those with impetigo recover\\nquickly , completely , and uneventfully . However, there is\\na chance of developing a serious disease, or sequela, es-\\npecially if the infection is left untreated. Local spread of\\nthe infection can cause osteomyelitis, septic arthritis,\\ncellulitis, or lymphangitis. If large quantities of the bac-\\nteria begin to circulate in the bloodstream, there is also a\\ndanger of developing a systemic infection such as\\nglomerulonephritis or pneumonia.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention of impetigo involves good hygiene. In\\norder to avoid spreading the infection from one person to\\nanother, those with impetigo should be isolated until all\\nsores are healed, and their used linen, clothing, and toys\\nshould be kept out of contact with others.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFoley , Denise, et al.

In some cases, low levels\\nof the male hormone testosterone may contribute to erec-\\ntile failure. Finally , such psychological factors as stress,\\nguilt, or anxiety , may also play a role, even when the\\nimpotence is primarily due to organic causes.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen diagnosing the underlying cause of impo-\\ntence, the doctor begins by asking the man a number of\\nquestions about when the problem began, whether it only\\nhappens with specific sex partners, and whether he ever\\nwakes up with an erection. (Men whose dysfunction oc-\\ncurs only with certain partners or who wake up with\\nerections are more likely to have a psychological cause\\nfor their impotence.) Sometimes, the man’s sex partner is\\nalso interviewed. In some cases, domestic discord may\\nbe a factor.\\nThe doctor also obtains a thorough medical history\\nto find out about past pelvic surgery , diabetes, cardiovas-\\ncular disease, kidney disease, and any medications the\\nman may be taking. The physical examination should in-\\nclude a genital examination, hormone tests, and a glu-\\ncose test for diabetes. Sometimes a measurement of\\nblood flow through the penis may be taken.\\nAlternative health practitioners often forgo such ex-\\ntensive testing and rely on information obtained from the\\npatient. Usually the fact that the man cannot get or main-\\ntain an erection is reason enough to begin alternative or\\nholistic therapy .\\nT reatment\\nA number of herbs have been promoted for treating\\nimpotence. The most widely touted is yohimbe (Cory-\\nnanthe yohimbe ), derived from the bark of the yohimbe\\ntree native to W est Africa. It has been used in Europe for\\nabout 75 years to treat erectile dysfunction. The FDA ap-\\nproved yohimbe as a treatment for impotence in the late\\n1980s. It is sold as an over-the-counter dietary supple-\\nment and as a prescription drug under brand names such\\nas Y ocon, Aphrodyne, Erex, Y ohimex, T estomar,\\nY ohimbe, and Y ovital.\\nThere is no clear medical research that indicates ex-\\nactly how or why yohimbe works in treating impotence.\\nIt is generally believed that yohimbe dilates blood ves-\\nsels and stimulates blood flow to the penis, causing an\\nerection. It also prevents blood from flowing out of the\\npenis during an erection. It may also act on the central\\nnervous system, specifically the lower spinal cord area\\nwhere sexual signals are transmitted. Studies show it is\\neffective in 30–40% of men with impotence. It is primar-\\nily effective in men with impotence caused by vascular,\\npsychogenic (originating in the mind), or diabetic prob-\\nlems. It usually does not work in men whose impotence\\nis caused by organic nerve damage. In healthy men with-\\nout impotence, yohimbe in some cases appears to in-\\ncrease sexual stamina and prolong erections.\\nThe usual dosage of yohimbine (yohimbe extract) to\\ntreat erectile dysfunction is 5.4 mg three times a day . It\\nmay take three to six weeks for it to take effect. Most\\ncommercially available supplements don’t contain\\nenough yohimbe to be effective. Doctors recommend ob-\\ntaining a prescription for yohimbe to get enough active\\ningredient for success.\\nGinkgo ( Ginkgo biloba ) is also used to treat impo-\\ntence, although it has not been shown to help the condi-\\ntion in controlled studies and probably has more of a\\npsychological effect. In addition, ginkgo carries some\\nrisk of abnormal blood clotting and should be avoided by\\nmen taking such blood thinners, as coumadin. Other\\nherbs promoted for treating impotence include true uni-\\ncorn root ( Aletrius farinosa ), saw palmetto (Serenoa\\nrepens), ginseng (P anax ginseng), and Siberian ginseng\\n(Eleuthrococcus senticosus ). Nux vomica (Strychnos\\nnux-vomica ) has been recommended, especially when\\nimpotence is caused by excessive alcohol, cigarettes, or\\ndietary indiscretions. Nux vomica can be very toxic if\\ntaken improperly , so it should be used only under the\\nstrict supervision of a physician trained in its use.\\nThere are quite a few Chinese herbal remedies for\\nimpotence, usually combinations of herbs and some-\\ntimes such animal parts as deer antler and sea horse.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nY ears ago, the standard treatment for impotence was\\na penile implant or long-term psychotherapy . Although\\nphysical causes are now more readily diagnosed and\\ntreated, individual or marital counseling is still an effec-\\ntive treatment for impotence when emotional factors\\nplay a role. Fortunately , other approaches are now avail-\\nable to treat the physical causes of impotence.\\nThe most common treatment today is with the pre-\\nscription drug sildenafil citrate, sold under the brand\\nname V iagra. An estimated 20 million prescriptions for\\nthe pill have been filled since it was approved by the\\nFDA in March 1998. It is also the most effective treat-\\nment, with a success rate of more than 60%.

At least 130 men have died while taking V iagra.\\nShortly after use of the drug skyrocketed, concerns were\\nexpressed over cardiovascular effects from Viagra. How-\\never, studies reported in 2002 that sildenafil had no ef-\\nfect on cardiac symptoms in older men who used it. In-\\nstead, cardiac events reported with use of Viagra are\\nmore likely the result of the physical demands of sexual\\nactivity in patients using the drug who were already at\\nhigher risk for cardiovascular disease.\\nIn the summer of 2002, two investigational drugs\\nwere announced to become available in the near future to\\nalso treat erectile dysfunction. V ardenafil and tadalafil\\nboth helped men who also had such conditions as dia-\\nbetes, high blood pressure and benign prostatic hypertro-\\nphy . The drugs are awaiting final FDA approval.\\nV ardenafil and tadalafil belong to the same group of\\nchemical compounds as sildenafil, namely phosphodi-\\nesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. Some men cannot\\nbenefit from sildenafil or the two newer PDE-5 inhibitors\\nbecause they have low levels of nitric oxide. British in-\\nvestigators reported in late 2002 that three different types\\nof compounds are being studied as possible medications\\nfor men with low levels of nitric oxide. They are Rho-ki-\\nnase inhibitors, soluble guanylate cyclase activators, and\\nnitric oxide-releasing PDE-5 inhibitors.\\nOther medications under investigation as treatments\\nfor impotence are topical agents. T opical means that they\\nare applied externally to the skin rather than being inject-\\ned or taken by mouth. If approved, these drugs would\\nprovide a noninvasive alternative for men who cannot\\ntake sildenafil or other oral medications for impotence.\\nOther traditional therapies for impotence include\\nvacuum pump therapy , injection therapy involving in-\\njecting a substance into the penis to enhance blood flow ,\\nand a penile implantation device. In rare cases, if nar-\\nrowed or diseased veins are responsible for impotence,\\nsurgeons may reroute the blood flow into the corpus cav-\\nernosa or remove leaking vessels.\\nA newer approach to the treatment of erectile dys-\\nfunction is gene therapy . As of late 2002, several preclin-\\nical studies have shown promise, but none of the gene-\\nbased strategies so far have yet been tested for safety .\\nExpected results\\nWith proper diagnosis, impotence can nearly always\\nbe treated or coped with successfully . Unfortunately ,\\nfewer than 10% of impotent men seek treatment.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no specific treatment to prevent impotence.\\nPerhaps the most important measure is to maintain gen-\\neral good health and avoid atherosclerosis by exercising\\nregularly , controlling weight, controlling hypertension\\nand high cholesterol levels, and not smoking.

Certain prescription drugs as well as\\nover-the-counter medications can irritate the stomach\\nlining. These medications include nonsteroidal anti-in-\\nflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, or over-the-counter pain\\nkillers like aspirin), some antibiotics, digoxin, theo-\\nphylline, corticosteroids, iron (ferrous sulfate), oral\\ncontraceptives, and tricyclic antidepressants.\\n• Disorders of the pancreas and gallbladder. These in-\\nclude inflammation of the gallbladder or pancreas, can-\\ncer of the pancreas, and gallstones.\\n• Intestinal parasites. Parasitic infections that cause in-\\ndigestion include amebiasis, fluke and tapeworm infec-\\ntions, giardiasis, and strongyloidiasis.\\n• Systemic disorders, including diabetes, thyroid disease,\\nand collagen vascular disease.\\n• Cancers of the digestive tract.\\n• Conditions associated with women’s reproductive or-\\ngans. These conditions include menstrual cramps,\\npregnancy, and pelvic inflammatory disease.\\nPsychologic & emotional causes\\nIndigestion often accompanies an emotional upset,\\nbecause the part of the nervous system involved in the\\nso-called “fight-or-flight” response also affects the di-\\ngestive tract. People diagnosed with anxiety or somato-\\nform disorders frequently have problems with indiges-\\ntion. Many people in the general population, however,\\nwill also experience heartburn, “butterflies in the stom-\\nach, ” or stomach cramps when they are in upsetting situ-\\nations—such as school examinations, arguments with\\nfamily members, crises in their workplace, and so on.\\nSome people’s digestive systems appear to react more in-\\ntensely to emotional stress due to hypersensitive nerve\\nendings in their intestinal tract.\\nSpecific gastrointestinal disorders\\nIn some cases, the patient’s description of the symp-\\ntoms suggests a specific digestive disorder as the cause\\nof the indigestion. Some doctors classify these cases into\\nthree groups:\\nESOPHAGITIS TYPE. Esophagitis is an inflammation\\nof the tube that carries food from the throat to the stom-\\nach (the esophagus). The tissues of the esophagus can\\nbecome irritated by the flow (reflux) of stomach acid\\nbackward into the lower part of the esophagus. If the pa-\\ntient describes the indigestion in terms of frequent or in-\\ntense heartburn, the doctor will consider gastroe-\\nsophageal reflux disease (GERD) as a possible cause.\\nGERD is a common disorder in the general population,\\naffecting about 30% of adults. In 2001, a study showed\\nthat obesity impairs the antireflux action. Those that are\\noverweight have more severe reflux than most patients.\\nNighttime GERD affects 79% of adults with heartburn\\nand is potentially more destructive to the esophagus than\\ndaytime indigestion. Another study found that acid re-\\nflux leads to cough and wheezing problems, particularly\\nin people with asthma.\\nGERD also affects some infants and children, and is\\na common cause of babies spitting up formula. In most\\ncases, the condition resolves itself, but children older\\nthan one year with regularly occurring pain in the lower\\nchest or upper abdomen should cause concern. If a child\\nis bothered by these symptoms during sleep or activities,\\na physician should be consulted.\\nPEPTIC ULCER TYPE. Patients who smoke and are\\nover 45 are more likely to have indigestion of the peptic\\nulcer type. This group also includes people who find that\\ntheir indigestion is relieved by taking antacids or eating a\\nsmall amount of food. Patients in this category are often\\nfound to have Helicobacter pylori infections.

Most people with H. pylori infections do\\nnot develop chronic indigestion, but the organism ap-\\npears to cause peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in a vulnerable\\nsegment of the population.\\nNONULCER TYPE. Most cases of chronic indiges-\\ntion—as many as 65%—fall into this third category .\\nNonulcer dyspepsia is sometimes called functional dyspep-\\nsia because it appears to be related to abnormalities in the\\nway that the stomach empties its contents into the intestine.\\nIn some people, the stomach empties either too slowly or\\ntoo rapidly . In others, the stomach’s muscular contractions\\nare irregular and uncoordinated. These disorders of stom-\\nach movement (motility) may be caused by hypersensitive\\nnerve endings in the stomach tissues. Patients in this group\\nare likely to be younger than 45 and have a history of tak-\\ning medications for anxiety or depression.\\nDiagnosis\\nPatient history\\nBecause indigestion is a nonspecific set of symp-\\ntoms, patients who feel sick enough to seek medical at-\\ntention are likely to go to their primary care doctor. The\\nhistory does not always point to an obvious diagnosis.\\nThe doctor can, however, use the process of history-tak-\\ning to evaluate the patient’s mood or emotional state in\\norder to assess the possibility of a psychiatric distur-\\nbance. In addition, asking about the location, intensity ,\\ntiming, and recurrence of the indigestion can help the\\ndoctor weigh the different diagnostic possibilities.\\nAn important part of the history-taking is asking\\nabout symptoms that may indicate a serious illness.\\nThese warning symptoms include:\\n• weight loss\\n• persistent vomiting\\n• difficulty or pain in swallowing\\n• vomiting blood or passing blood in the stools\\n• anemia\\nImaging studies\\nIf the doctor thinks that the indigestion should be in-\\nvestigated further, he or she will order an endoscopic ex-\\namination of the stomach. An endoscope is a slender\\ntube-shaped instrument that allows the doctor to look at\\nthe lining of the patient’s stomach. If the patient has indi-\\ngestion of the esophagitis type or nonulcer type, the\\nstomach lining will appear normal. If the patient has\\nPUD, the doctor will be able to see breaks or ulcerated\\nareas in the tissue. He or she may also order ultrasound\\nimaging of the abdomen, or a radionuclide scan to evalu-\\nate the motility of the stomach.\\nLaboratory tests\\nBLOOD TESTS. If the patient is over 45, the doctor will\\nhave the patient’s blood analyzed for a complete blood cell\\ncount, measurements of liver enzyme levels, electrolyte\\nand serum calcium levels, and thyroid function.\\nTESTS FOR HELICOBACTER PYLORI. Doctors can now\\ntest patients for the presence of H. pylori without having to\\ntake a tissue sample from the stomach. One of these nonin-\\nvasive tests is a blood test and the other is a breath test.\\nT reatment\\nNutritional supplements\\nNutritionists or naturopaths may recommend the\\nfollowing to improve digestion:\\n• Stay away from foods that may cause an upset stom-\\nach. These include spicy , fried, cured, or junk foods,\\ncucumbers, onions, peppers, tomatoes, beans, soda\\npop, or beverages containing caffeine.\\n• Eat lighter but more frequent meals.\\n• A void smoking.\\n• Adopt a high-fiber diet to improve regularity and treat\\nsuch digestive problems as constipation, hemorrhoids,\\nirritable bowel disease, and colon cancer. A high-fiber\\ndiet provides such additional health benefits as boosting\\nthe immune system function and preventing heart dis-\\nease, cancer, and other diseases.\\n• Increase water intake. Proper hydration helps the diges-\\ntive system work better.\\n• Improve poor digestive enzyme function with hy-\\ndrochloric acid and pancreatic enzyme supplements\\nsuch as lipase, amylase, and protease.\\n• Thickening a baby’s food can help with reflux (add one\\ntablespoon of dry rice cereal to each ounce of formula\\nor breast milk). Hold babies upright after feedings\\nrather than putting them down right away .\\nHerbal medicine\\nPractitioners of Chinese traditional herbal medicine\\nmight recommend medicines derived from peony (P aeonia\\nlactiflora), hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa ), or hare’s ear\\n(Bupleurum chinense) to treat indigestion.

In most cases, oil or lotion is used\\nas it would be on an adult subject by a trained and licensed\\nmassage therapist. Medical professionals caring for infants\\nmight also use massage techniques on infants born prema-\\nturely , on those with motor or gastrointestinal problems, or\\non those who have been exposed to cocaine in utero.\\nOrigins\\nThe practice of massaging infants dates back to an-\\ncient times, particularly in Asian and Pacific Island cul-\\ntures; that is, massage was a component of the baby’s reg-\\nular bath routine among the Maoris and Hawaiians. T ouch\\nin these cultures is considered healthful both physically\\nand spiritually . In the W est, however, infant massage has\\nreceived more attention in recent years in conjunction\\nwith the popularity of natural childbirth and midwife-as-\\nsisted births. Dr. Frédéric Leboyer, a French physician\\nwho was one of the leaders of the natural childbirth move-\\nment, helped to popularize infant massage through his\\nphotojournalistic book on the Indian art of baby massage.\\nInfant massage was introduced formally into the\\nUnited States in 1978, when V imala Schneider McClure,\\na yoga practitioner who served in an orphanage in\\nNorthern India, developed a training program for in-\\nstructors at the request of childbirth educators. An early\\nresearch study by R. Rice in 1976 had showed that pre-\\nmature babies who were massaged surged ahead in\\nweight gain and neurological development over those\\nwho were not massaged. From McClure’s training in\\nIndia, her knowledge of Swedish massage and reflexol-\\nogy , along with her knowledge of yoga postures that she\\nhad already adapted for babies, she became the foremost\\nauthority on infant massage. In 1986 she founded the In-\\nternational Association of Infant Massage (IAIM), which\\nhas 27 chapters worldwide as of 2000.\\nBenefits\\nResearch from experiments conducted at the T ouch\\nResearch Institutes at the University of Miami School of\\nMedicine and Nova Southeastern University has been\\ncited for the clinical benefits massage has on infants and\\nchildren. Tiffany Field, Ph. D., director, noted that the re-\\nsearch “.. suggests that touch is as important to infants and\\nchildren as eating and sleeping. T ouch therapy triggers\\nmany physiological changes that help infants and children\\ngrow and develop. For example, massage can stimulate\\nnerves in the brain which facilitate food absorption, result-\\ning in faster weight gain. It also lowers level of stress hor-\\nmones, resulting in improved immune function. ”\\nThe benefits of infant massage include:\\n• relaxation\\n• relief from stress\\n• interaction with adults\\n• stimulation of the nervous system\\nThe results of several studies showed that infant mas-\\nsage alleviates the stress that newborns experience as a re-\\nsult of the enormous change that birth brings about in their\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21062\\nInfant massage\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1062'),\n",

The environment in which\\nthe massage is given to an infant should be comfortably\\nwarm, and as calm and nonthreatening as possible.\\nPrecautions\\nExtreme caution is necessary when performing in-\\nfant massage.

Having entered the body ,\\npathogens begin to reproduce. Most pathogens are kept in\\ncheck before they have a chance to multiply . If, however,\\nthe body is unable to keep the pathogens in balance, seri-\\nous disease and even death may occur. Chronic infections\\nmay develop if the body has only limited control over a\\ngiven pathogen. In that case, the infection will have a ten-\\ndency to flare up in response to stress and weakness.

This\\ntype of infection affects the entire body .\\nThe body has many natural barriers to infection. For\\nexample, the harmless bacteria normally found on the\\nskin, known as commensals, inhibit the growth of many\\npathogens. Sweat and oil gland secretions also protect\\nthe skin; and the skin itself offers a significant physical\\nbarrier that no bacteria are able to penetrate. Damage to\\nthe skin from burns , insect bites, surgery , or injuries\\nmay leave the skin open to infection. In addition to the\\nphysical barrier of the skin, many of the body’s secre-\\ntions such as tears, sweat, urine, and saliva contain\\nchemicals that destroy pathogens.\\nThe mucous membranes that line the passageways\\nof the body secrete mucus, which contains enzymes and\\nchemicals that kill or disable pathogens. The pathogens\\nare then trapped in the mucus and filtered out or swal-\\nlowed. Commensal bacteria also live on the mucous\\nmembranes; there they inhibit the spread and multiplica-\\ntion of pathogens just as they do on the skin. The diges-\\ntive tract contains stomach acid, pancreatic enzymes, and\\nother secretions that protect against infection. Peristalsis\\nand the shedding of the lining of the intestinal tract also\\nhelp to remove pathogens. The acid pH of the stomach\\nand vagina is protective, as well as the length of the ure-\\nthra in males. The flushing action of urine and feces as\\nthey are excreted also protect against infection.\\nA fever is defined as the elevation of the body tem-\\nperature to at least 100°F (37.8°C). Fevers are a helpful\\npart of the body’s response to an infection, since most\\npathogens do not thrive at higher temperatures while the\\nimmune system’s white blood cells (WBCs) work best in\\na warm environment. If the fever reaches levels of 102°F\\n(38.9°C) or higher, it may have to be brought down to\\navoid seizures, dehydration, and tissue damage.\\nThe second level of the body’s defenses is the im-\\nmune system. The white blood cells are a major part of\\nthis system. In response to the invasion of pathogens,\\nWBCs are released from the bone marrow into the\\nbloodstream. The main function of these WBCs, depend-\\ning on their type, is to engulf pathogens and render them\\nharmless, detoxify poisons, produce and release antibod-\\nies and chemicals, and clean up wastes left by other\\nWBCs. The spleen, thymus, lymph system, and liver all\\nhave roles in the immune response. Successful removal\\nof pathogens from the body often gives immunity against\\ninfection by that pathogen in the future.\\nPathogens can be persistent. They may secrete en-\\nzymes, destroying tissues in the body to spread the infec-\\ntion more quickly and effectively . They may secrete\\nchemicals that counteract the actions of the WBCs. Some\\npathogens release toxins that kill the surrounding cells.\\nMany also have methods to evade being engulfed and de-\\nstroyed. In addition, the body’s own commensal bacteria\\nmay become pathogenic if something upsets their bal-\\nanced state in the body . This loss of balance may often re-\\nsult from chronic illness, low stomach acid, recurrent use\\nof antibiotics, cross-contamination through medical or\\nsexual exploration, or a compromised immune system.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nInfections are caused by pathogens invading the tis-\\nsues of the body and beginning to multiply . Headaches,\\nmuscle aches, fever, chills , and fatigue are common\\nsymptoms of infections. Many of these symptoms are\\ndue to inflammation and the response of the immune\\nsystem to the pathogens. For example, during an infec-\\ntion, the blood supply is increased to the affected areas;\\nas the blood rushes to the site of infection, it causes the\\nskin to redden. The blood vessels also become more\\nreadily able to release WBCs into the tissues; when the\\nWBCs die and decay they form a thick fluid known as\\npus. Enzymes released by the WBCs may also be re-\\nsponsible for pain and swelling.\\nMore specific symptoms of infection vary according\\nto the site and type of the infection. Some of these symp-\\ntoms include:\\n• Gastrointestinal system: Diarrhea , vomiting, nausea,\\nstomachaches, cramps, gas pains, and dehydration.\\n• Respiratory system: Coughing, sneezing , sore throat ,\\ncongestion, fever, bronchitis, and runny nose.\\n• Urinary system: Increased frequency and urgency of\\nurination; pain on urination; blood, pus, or other dis-\\ncharge in the urine; bad-smelling urine or discharge;\\nand vaginal itching.\\n• Skin: Rashes , sores, itching, and blisters ; redness,\\nswelling, tenderness, and pain.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1065\\nInfections\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1065'),\n",

Many infections have a high probabili-\\nty of being passed from person to person. This is espe-\\ncially true of respiratory diseases, which can be transmit-\\nted through contact with the sputum and droplets pro-\\nduced by coughing or sneezing. Contact with infected\\nwaste products, open sores, skin eruptions, infected cloth-\\ning and bedclothes, and sexual contact are circumstances\\nwhich often lead to the further spread of infections.\\nNew concerns about infections continue to baffle re-\\nsearchers and clinicians into the twenty-first century .\\nFirst, the world faces the threat of infection from bioter-\\nrorism, and Americans faced a scare from deliberate dis-\\ntribution of anthrax spores through the United States\\npostal system following the September 11, 2001, terror-\\nist attack. The year 1999 saw the first reports of the W est\\nNile virus in the United States, and reported cases of the\\ndisease began spreading after that date. Further, clini-\\ncians worry about widespread antibiotic resistance, as in-\\ndividuals and the public at large become exposed to\\nmore antibiotics for longer periods of time.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany infections are minor and self-limiting. Some\\ninfections, however, are serious; some can even lead to\\npermanent impairment or death. If an infection does not\\nclear up within a few days, or if it gets worse, a health-\\ncare provider should be consulted. Infections are initially\\ndiagnosed by the patient’s presentation and by a history\\nof the illness or injury and the symptoms.\\nA complete blood count (CBC) is a simple clinical\\ntest that can be used to diagnose an infection. Increases\\nin the total WBC count usually indicate a bacterial infec-\\ntion; decreases tend to indicate a viral infection or a very\\nsevere infection, both of which may cause the destruc-\\ntion of WBCs faster than they can be produced. Increas-\\nes in specific types of white blood cells known as neu-\\ntrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes also point to an\\ninfection. An increase in eosinophils may be due to a\\nparasitic infection. A blood chemistry panel may be\\ntaken to determine whether there are chemical changes\\nthat may have been brought on by an infection.\\nA serious illness may require further evaluation and\\ndiagnostic tests. Additional laboratory tests can be per-\\nformed using blood, feces, or samples of the infected tis-\\nsue. Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scans, and\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used. In\\nsome cases, a tissue sample (biopsy) is taken from the\\naffected site for microbial culture tests and microscopic\\nexamination.\\nT reatment\\nHerbal therapy\\nEchinacea spp. enhances the action of the immune\\nsystem. It can be taken for up to six weeks to prevent or\\nheal infections. Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis ) has\\nstrong antibiotic qualities. Garlic (Allium sativum ) is\\nalso antibiotic. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) has signif-\\nicant antiviral activity . It reduces the bad effects of stress\\non the health, and has been used to treat herpes, staphy-\\nlococcal and streptococcal infections, typhus, cholera,\\npneumonia, and infections caused by Candida albicans.\\nAstragalus membranaceus is a Chinese herb that may be\\nused to enhance the immune system as well as to prevent\\nthe recurrence of chronic infections. Pau d’arco\\n(T abebuia impetiginosa ) is recommended for internal\\nfungal infections , while the topical use of tea tree oil\\n(Melaleuca alternfolia ) is recommended for some exter-\\nnal infections.\\nDietary modifications\\nA healthful balanced diet and lifestyle are important\\nsupports of the immune function. Reishi (Ganoderma lu-\\ncidum), shiitake ( Lentinus edodes ), and maitake (Grifo-\\nla frondosa) mushrooms are renowned for their ability to\\nstrengthen the immune system and their antimicrobial\\nproperties. Regular supplementation with vitamin C, vi-\\ntamin A or beta-carotene, zinc , and bioflavonoids is\\nalso recommended to boost the immune response.\\nSugary foods, including honey , may depress the im-\\nmune system.

Odle\\nInfectious mononucleosis see\\nMononucleosis\\nInfertility\\nDefinition\\nInfertility is the failure of a couple to conceive a\\npregnancy after trying to do so for at least one full year.\\nIn primary infertility , pregnancy has never occurred. In\\nsecondary infertility , one or both members of the couple\\nhave previously conceived, but are unable to conceive\\nagain after a full year of trying.\\nDescription\\nApproximately 20% of couples struggle with infer-\\ntility at any given time. Infertility has increased as a\\nproblem over the last 30 years. Some studies blame this\\nincrease on social phenomena, including the tendency\\nfor marriage and starting a family to occur at a later age.\\nFor women, fertility decreases with increasing age:\\n• Infertility in married women ages 16–20 = 4.5%.\\n• Infertility in married women ages 35–40 = 31.8%.\\n• Infertility in married women over the age of 40 = 70%.\\nPresently , individuals often have several sexual part-\\nners before they marry and try to have children. This in-\\ncrease in numbers of sexual partners has led to an in-\\ncrease in sexually transmitted diseases. Scarring from\\nthese infections , especially from pelvic inflammatory\\ndisease (infection of the female reproductive organs)\\nseems to be in part responsible for the rise in infertility .\\nFurthermore, use of some forms of the contraceptive\\ncalled the intrauterine device (IUD) has contributed to an\\nincreased rate of pelvic inflammatory disease, with sub-\\nsequent scarring. A study in 2001 found that copper\\nIUDs have probably been wrongfully blamed for tubal\\ninfertility , while infection from the sexually transmitted\\ndisease chlamydia was likely the cause.\\nT o understand the causes of infertility , it is first nec-\\nessary to understand the basics of human reproduction.\\nFertilization occurs when a sperm from the male merges\\nwith an egg (ovum) from the female, creating a zygote\\nthat contains genetic material (DNA) from both the fa-\\nther and the mother. If pregnancy is then established, the\\nzygote will develop into an embryo, then a fetus, and ul-\\ntimately , if all goes well, a baby will be born.\\nSperm are small cells that carry the father’s genetic\\nmaterial. The sperm are mixed into a fluid called semen,\\nwhich is discharged from the penis during sexual inter-\\ncourse. The whiplike tail of the sperm allows the sperm to\\nswim up the female reproductive tract, in search of an egg.\\nThe ovum is the cell that carries the mother’s genet-\\nic material. Once a month, a single mature ovum is pro-\\nduced, and leaves the ovary in a process called ovulation.\\nThis ovum enters a tube leading to the uterus (the fallop-\\nian tube) where fertilization occurs.\\nWhen fertilization occurs, the resulting cell (which\\nnow contains genetic material from both the mother and\\nthe father) is called the zygote. This single cell will di-\\nvide into multiple cells and the resulting cluster of cells\\n(called a blastocyst) moves into the womb (uterus). The\\nuterine lining (endometrium) has been preparing itself to\\nreceive a pregnancy by growing thicker. If the blastocyst\\nsuccessfully attaches itself to the wall of the uterus, then\\npregnancy has been achieved.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nUnlike most medical problems, infertility is an issue\\nrequiring the careful evaluation of two separate individu-\\nals, as well as an evaluation of their interactions with\\neach other. In about 3–4% of couples, no cause for their\\ninfertility will be discovered.

T o check for these char-\\nacteristics, a sample of semen is obtained and examined\\nunder the microscope (semen analysis). Four basic char-\\nacteristics are usually evaluated:\\n• Sperm count refers to the number of sperm present in a\\nsemen sample. The normal number of sperm present in\\njust 1 ml of semen is over 20 million. A man with only\\n5–20 million sperm is considered subfertile and a man\\nwith fewer than 5 million sperm is considered infertile.\\n• Sperm are also examined to see how well they swim\\n(sperm motility) and to be sure that most have normal\\nstructure.\\n• Not all sperm within a specimen of semen will be per-\\nfectly normal. Some may be immature, and some may\\nhave abnormalities of the head or tail. A normal semen\\nsample will contain no more than 25% abnormal forms\\nof sperm.\\n• V olume of the semen sample is important. An abnormal\\namount of semen could affect the ability of the sperm\\nto successfully fertilize an ovum.\\nAny number of conditions result in abnormal find-\\nings in the semen analysis. Men can be born with testi-\\ncles that have not descended properly from the abdomi-\\nnal cavity (where testicles develop originally) into the\\nscrotal sac, or may be born with only one instead of the\\nnormal two testicles. T esticle size can be smaller than\\nnormal. Past infection (including mumps) can affect tes-\\nticular function, as can a past injury . The presence of ab-\\nnormally large veins (varicocele) in the testicles can in-\\ncrease testicular temperature, which decreases sperm\\ncount. History of having been exposed to various toxins,\\ndrug use, excess alcohol use, use of anabolic steroids,\\ncertain medications, diabetes, thyroid problems, or other\\nendocrine disturbances can have direct effects on the for-\\nmation of sperm (spermatogenesis). A study published in\\nlate 2001 linked certain organic solvents that men en-\\ncounter in the workplace as possible causes of low sperm\\ncount. The types of solvents are most likely encountered\\nin such occupations as those of professional printers,\\npainters, and decorators. Theories suggest solvents like\\nglycol ethers, which are know to affect animals’ repro-\\nductive systems, are the most harmful.\\nProblems with the male anatomy can cause sperm to\\nbe ejaculated not out of the penis, but into the bladder;\\nand scarring from past infections can interfere with ejac-\\nulation.\\nStudies continue to uncover reasons for male infer-\\ntility . In 2001, researchers reported that a certain protein\\nlacking in the sperm could prevent formation of the\\nstructure on the head of the sperm that contains enzymes\\nthat help penetrate the egg, allowing conception. The\\nfinding should lead to further study of the molecular\\nbasis of male fertility .\\nOvulatory problems\\nThe first step in diagnosing ovulatory problems is to\\nmake sure that an ovum is being produced each month.\\nA woman’s morning body temperature is slightly higher\\naround the time of ovulation. A woman can measure and\\nrecord her temperatures daily and a chart can be drawn\\nto show whether or not ovulation has occurred. Luteiniz-\\ning hormone (LH) is released just before ovulation. A\\nsimple urine test can be done to check if LH has been re-\\nleased around the time that ovulation is expected.\\nPelvic adhesions & endometriosis\\nPelvic adhesions cause infertility by blocking the\\nfallopian tubes and preventing the sperm from reaching\\nthe egg. Pelvic adhesions are fibrous scars. These scars\\ncan be the result of past infections, such as pelvic in-\\nflammatory disease, or infections following abortions or\\nprior births. Previous abdominal surgeries can also leave\\nbehind scarring.\\nEndometriosis is the abnormal location of uterine\\ntissue outside of the uterus. When uterine tissue is plant-\\ned elsewhere in the pelvis, it still bleeds on a monthly\\nbasis with the start of the normal menstrual period. This\\nleads to irritation within the pelvis around the site of this\\nabnormal tissue and bleeding, and may cause scarring.\\nEndometriosis may lead to pelvic adhesions.\\nA hysterosalpingogram (HSG) can show if the fal-\\nlopian tubes are blocked. This is an x-ray exam that tests\\nwhether dye material can travel through the patient’s fal-\\nlopian tubes. Scarring also can be diagnosed by examin-\\ning the pelvic area through the use of a laparoscope that\\nis inserted into the abdomen through a tiny incision\\nmade near the navel.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1069\\nInfertility\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1069'),\n",

Mucus pro-\\nduced by the cervix helps to transport the sperm into the\\nuterus. Injury to the cervix or scarring of the cervix after\\nsurgery or infection can result in a smaller than normal\\ncervical opening, making it difficult for the sperm to\\nenter. Injury or infection can also decrease the number of\\nglands in the cervix, leading to a smaller amount of cer-\\nvical mucus. In other situations, the mucus produced is\\nthe wrong consistency (perhaps too thick) to allow sperm\\nto travel through. In addition, some women produce anti-\\nbodies (immune cells) that are specifically directed to\\nidentify sperm as foreign invaders and to kill them.\\nCervical mucus can be examined under a micro-\\nscope to diagnose whether cervical factors are contribut-\\ning to infertility . The interaction of a live sperm sample\\nfrom the male partner and a sample of cervical mucus\\nfrom the female partner can also be examined.

(Photo\\nResearchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)\\nDescription\\nThe primary problem in IBD is inflammation, as the\\nname suggests. Inflammation is a process that often oc-\\ncurs to fight off foreign invaders in the body , including\\nviruses, bacteria, and fungi. In response to such organ-\\nisms, the body’s immune system begins to produce a va-\\nriety of cells and chemicals intended to stop the invasion.\\nThese immune cells and chemicals, however, also have\\ndirect effects on the body’s tissues, resulting in heat, red-\\nness, swelling, and loss of function. No one knows what\\nstarts the cycle of inflammation in IBD, but the result is\\na swollen, boggy intestine.\\nIn ulcerative colitis, the inflammation affects the lin-\\ning of the rectum and large intestine. It is thought that\\nthe inflammation typically begins in the last segment of\\nlarge intestine, which empties into the rectum (sigmoid\\ncolon). This inflammation may spread through the entire\\nlarge intestine, but only rarely affects the very last sec-\\ntion of the small intestine (ileum). The rest of the small\\nintestine remains normal.\\nCrohn’s disease is a form of IBD that affects both\\nthe small and large intestines. The inflammation of ul-\\ncerative colitis occurs only in the lining of the intestine\\n(unlike Crohn’s disease which affects all of the layers of\\nthe intestinal wall). As the inflammation continues, the\\ntissue of the intestine begins to slough off, leaving pits\\n(ulcerations) that often become infected.\\nIBD can occur in all age groups, with the most com-\\nmon age of diagnosis being 15–35 years of age. Men and\\nwomen are affected equally . Whites are more frequently\\naffected than other racial groups, and people of Jewish\\norigin have three to six times greater likelihood of suffer-\\ning from IBD. IBD is familial; an IBD patient has a 20%\\nchance of having other relatives who are fellow sufferers.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nNo specific cause of IBD has been identified. Al-\\nthough no organism (virus, bacteria, or fungi) has been\\nfound to set off the cycle of inflammation, some re-\\nsearchers continue to suspect that an organism is respon-\\nsible. Other researchers are concentrating on identifying\\nsome change in the cells of the colon that would make\\nthe body’s immune system accidentally begin treating\\nthose cells as foreign. Additional evidence for a disorder\\nof the immune system includes the high number of other\\nimmune disorders that frequently accompany IBD. The\\ncondition has also been linked to physical, mental, and\\nemotional stress.\\nThe first symptoms of IBD are abdominal cramping\\nand pain , a sensation of urgent need to have a bowel\\nmovement (defecate), and blood and pus in the stools.\\nSome patients experience diarrhea , fever , and weight\\nloss. If the diarrhea continues, signs of severe fluid loss\\n(dehydration) begin to appear, including low blood pres-\\nsure, fast heart rate, and dizziness.\\nSevere complications of IBD include perforation of\\nthe intestine, toxic dilation (enlargement) of the colon,\\nand the development of colon cancer. Intestinal perfora-\\ntion occurs when long-standing inflammation and ulcer-\\nation of the intestine weaken the wall to such an extent\\nthat a hole occurs. This is a life-threatening complica-\\ntion, because the contents of the intestine (which contain\\na large number of bacteria) spill into the abdomen. The\\npresence of bacteria in the abdomen can result in a mas-\\nsive infection called peritonitis.\\nT oxic dilation of the colon is thought to occur be-\\ncause the intestinal inflammation interferes with the nor-\\nmal function of the muscles of the intestine. This allows\\nthe intestine to become lax, and its diameter begins to in-\\ncrease. The enlarged diameter thins the walls further, in-\\ncreasing the risk of perforation and peritonitis. When the\\ndiameter of the intestine is quite large and infection is\\npresent, the condition is referred to as “toxic megacolon. ”\\nPatients with IBD have a significant risk of develop-\\ning colon cancer. This risk seems to begin around 10\\nyears after diagnosis. The overall risk of developing can-\\ncer seems to be greatest for those patients with the\\nlargest extent of intestine involved. The risk becomes\\nstatistically greater every year:\\n• At 10 years, the risk of cancer is about 0.5–1%.\\n• At 15 years, the risk of cancer is about 12%.\\n• At 20 years, the risk of cancer is about 23%.\\n• At 24 years, the risk of cancer is about 42%.\\nPatients with IBD also have a high chance of experi-\\nencing other disorders, including inflammation of the\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1073'),\n",

Examination of the stool will\\nusually reveal the presence of blood and pus (white\\nblood cells). Blood tests may show an increase in the\\nnumber of white blood cells, which is an indication of\\ninflammation occurring somewhere in the body . The\\nblood test may also reveal anemia , particularly when a\\ngreat deal of blood has been lost in the stool.\\nThe most important allopathic method of diagnosis\\nis endoscopy , during which a doctor passes a flexible\\ntube with a tiny fiberoptic camera device through the\\nrectum and into the colon. The doctor can then examine\\nthe lining of the intestine for signs of inflammation and\\nulceration. A tiny sample (biopsy) of the intestine will be\\nremoved through the endoscope, which will be examined\\nunder a microscope for evidence of IBD. X-ray examina-\\ntion is helpful to determine the amount of affected intes-\\ntine. However, x-ray examinations requiring the use of\\nbarium should be delayed until treatment has begun.\\nBarium is a chalky solution that the patient drinks or is\\ngiven through the rectum and into the intestine (enema).\\nThe presence of barium in the intestine allows more de-\\ntail to be seen on x ray films.\\nT reatment\\nTreatment for IBD targets the underlying inflamma-\\ntion, as well as the problems occurring due to continued\\ndiarrhea and blood loss. The use of alternative medicines\\nin the treatment of IBD is common. IBD sufferers have\\nused a variety of treatments; however, few controlled\\nstudies of their effectiveness have been performed.\\nChamomile tea is used to treat IBD. Chamomile is\\nknown to have anti-inflammatory , antispasmodic, and\\nantibacterial properties. The patient should steep dried\\nflowers for 10 to 15 minutes and drink three to four cups\\ndaily . Chamomile can cause allergic reactions in those\\nwho are allergic to other daisies. Other antispasmodics\\ninclude valerian, wild yam, and cramp bark.\\nThere is some preliminary evidence that alteration\\nof the kinds of bacteria in the intestine prevents or con-\\ntrols colitis. Intestinal bacteria can be manipulated\\nthrough use of probiotics or prebiotics. Probiotics refers\\nto treatment with beneficial microbes either by ingestion\\nor through a suppository . Prebiotics refers to dietary\\nchanges that favor the overgrowth of beneficial mi-\\ncrobes. Preliminary animal and human studies have\\nshown that Lactobacilli and related bacteria can control\\ncolitis and prolong remission. Ingestion of the nondi-\\ngestable carbohydrates inulin or lactulose as prebiotics\\nstimulates growth of these beneficial bacteria.\\nIn a related treatment, preliminary evidence sug-\\ngests that ingestion of parasitic worm eggs eases the\\nsymptoms of IBD. Within two to three weeks, five out of\\nthe six IBD patients who ingested the eggs went into\\ncomplete remission which lasted one month. The tiny ,\\nharmless worms cannot reproduce in humans and are\\npassed out within a few months.\\nIngestion of enteric coated fish oil capsules may re-\\nduce the IBD relapse rate. A small study found that pa-\\ntients taking fish oil supplements had a lower relapse\\nrate (59%) than those on placebo (90%).\\nSeventy-two percent of ulcerative colitis patients tak-\\ning a Kui Jie Qing enema (alum, Halloysite, Calamine,\\nIndigo naturalis , and plum-blossom tongue-pointing\\npills) daily were considered cured, as compared with 5%\\nof those who were taking anti-inflammatory drugs. Fifty-\\nthree percent of ulcerative colitis patients taking Jian Pi\\nLing tablet and root of Sophorae flavescentis plus the\\nflower of sophora enema were considered cured, as com-\\npared with 28% of those taking sulfasalazine and dexam-\\nethasone and 19% of those taking a placebo tablet and the\\nenema.

Some-\\ntimes these are effective when drugs are not.\\nForty-five percent of ulcerative colitis patients on an\\nenzyme-potentiated hyposensitization protocol (B-glu-\\ncuronidase enzyme and 1,3-cyclohexanediol with egg,\\nmilk, wheat, potato, and yeast) were improved, as com-\\npared with 6% of those on placebo.\\nNutritionists often recommend changes in the diet\\nfor patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Food al-\\nlergies and certain kinds of food are linked with the in-\\ncreased incidence of the disease. Eliminating diary and\\nwheat products, common allergens, often alleviates\\nsymptoms. The incidence of Crohn’s disease is increas-\\ning in areas where people consume a diet high in refined\\nsugars and carbohydrates and saturated fats and low in\\ndietary fiber.

Because of poor ab-\\nsorption, sulfasalazine stays primarily within the intes-\\ntine, where it is broken down into its two components: an\\nantibiotic and an anti-inflammatory . It is believed to be\\nprimarily the anti-inflammatory component, salicylic\\nacid, that is active in treating IBD. For patients who do\\nnot respond to sulfasalazine, steroid medications (such\\nas prednisone) are the next choice.\\nDepending on the degree of blood loss, a patient\\nwith IBD may require blood transfusions and fluid re-\\nplacement through a needle in the vein (intravenous or\\nIV). Medications that can slow diarrhea must be used\\nwith great care, because they may actually cause the de-\\nvelopment of toxic megacolon.\\nA patient with toxic megacolon requires close moni-\\ntoring and care in the hospital. He or she will usually be\\ngiven steroid medications through an IV , and may be put\\non antibiotics. If these measures do not improve the situ-\\nation, the patient will have to undergo surgery to remove\\nthe colon. This is done because the risk of death after\\nperforation of toxic megacolon is greater than 50%.\\nA patient with proven cancer of the colon, or even a\\npatient who shows certain precancerous signs, will need a\\ncolectomy (colon removal). When a colectomy is per-\\nformed, a piece of the small intestine (ileum) is pulled\\nthrough an opening in the abdomen and fashioned surgi-\\ncally to allow attachment of a special bag to catch the\\nbody’s waste (feces). This opening, which will remain for\\nthe duration of the patient’s life, is called an ileostomy .\\nExpected results\\nRemission refers to a disease becoming inactive for\\na period of time.

Although the\\nstomach or intestinal “flu” is commonly blamed for\\nstomach upsets and diarrhea, the influenza virus affects\\nhumans less often than is commonly believed.\\nDescription\\nInfluenza is considerably more debilitating than the\\ncommon cold . Influenza outbreaks occur suddenly , and\\ninfection spreads rapidly . The annual death toll attribut-\\nable to influenza and its complications averages 20,000\\nin the United States alone. In the 1918-1919 Spanish flu\\npandemic, the death toll reached a staggering 20–40 mil-\\nlion worldwide. Approximately 500,000 of these fatali-\\nties occurred in North America.\\nInfluenza outbreaks occur on a regular basis. The\\nmost serious outbreaks are pandemics, which affect mil-\\nlions of people worldwide and last for several months.\\nThe 1918-19 influenza outbreak serves as the primary\\nexample of an influenza pandemic. Pandemics also oc-\\ncurred in 1957 and 1968 with the Asian flu and Hong\\nKong flu, respectively .\\nEpidemics are widespread regional outbreaks that\\noccur every two to three years and affect 5–10% of the pop-\\nulation. A regional epidemic is shorter lived than a pandem-\\nic, lasting only several weeks. Finally , there are smaller out-\\nbreaks each winter that are confined to specific locales.\\nThere are three types of influenza viruses, identified\\nas A, B, and C. Influenza A can infect a range of animal\\nspecies, including humans, pigs, horses, and birds, but\\nonly humans are infected by types B and C. Influenza A is\\nresponsible for most flu cases, while infection with types\\nB and C virus are less common and cause a milder illness.\\nIn the United States, 90% of all deaths from influen-\\nza occur among persons older than 65. Flu-related deaths\\nhave increased substantially in the United States since the\\n1970s, largely because of the aging of the American pop-\\nulation. In addition, elderly persons are vulnerable be-\\ncause they are often reluctant to be vaccinated against flu.\\nA new concern regarding influenza is the possibility\\nthat hostile groups or governments could use the virus as\\nan agent of bioterrorism. A report published in early\\n2003 noted that T ype A influenza virus has a high poten-\\ntial for use as such an agent because of the virulence of\\nthe T ype A strain that broke out in Hong Kong in 1997\\nand the development of laboratory methods for generat-\\ning large quantities of the virus. The report recommend-\\ned the stockpiling of present antiviral drugs and speeding\\nup the development of new ones.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nApproximately one to four days after infection with\\nthe influenza virus, the victim develops an array of\\nsymptoms. Symptoms are usually sudden, although the\\nsequence can be quite variable. They include the onset of\\nheadache, sore throat, dry cough, and chills, nasal con-\\ngestion, fatigue, malaise, overall achiness and a fever\\nthat may run as high as 104°F (40°C). Flu victims feel\\nextremely tired and weak, and may not return to their\\nnormal energy levels for several days or weeks.\\nInfluenza complications usually arise from bacterial\\ninfections of the lower respiratory tract. Signs of a sec-\\nondary respiratory infection often appear just as the pa-\\ntient seems to be recovering. These signs include high\\nfever, intense chills, chest pains associated with breath-\\ning, and a productive cough or sinus discharge with thick\\nyellowish-green sputum. If these symptoms appear, med-\\nical treatment is often necessary . Other secondary infec-\\ntions, such as sinus or ear infections, may also require\\nmedical intervention. Heart and lung problems and other\\nchronic diseases, can be aggravated by influenza, which\\nis a particular concern with elderly patients.\\nWith children and teenagers, it is advisable to be alert\\nfor symptoms of Reye’s syndrome, a rare but serious com-\\nplication that occurs when children are given aspirin.\\nSymptoms of Reye’s syndrome are nausea and vomiting,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21076\\nInfluenza\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1076'),\n",

The virus strains used to make the\\nvaccine are inactivated and will not cause illness. When\\nthere is a good match between the anticipated flu strains\\nand the strains used in the vaccine, the vaccine is 70-\\n90% effective in people under 65. Because immune re-\\nsponse diminishes somewhat with age, people over 65\\nmay not receive the same level of protection from the\\nvaccine, but even if they do contract the flu, the vaccine\\ndiminishes the severity and helps prevent complications.\\nIt should be noted that certain people should not re-\\nceive an influenza vaccine. Infants six months and\\nyounger have immature immune systems and will not\\nbenefit from the vaccine. Because the vaccines are pre-\\npared using hen eggs, people who have severe allergies\\nto eggs or other vaccine components should not receive\\nthe influenza vaccine. Some persons may receive a\\ncourse of amantadine or rimantadine, which are 70-90%\\neffective in preventing influenza.\\nCertain groups are strongly advised to be vaccinated\\nbecause they are at greater risk for influenza-related\\ncomplications:\\n• All people 65 years and older.\\n• Residents of nursing homes and chronic-care facilities.\\n• Adults and children who have chronic heart or lung\\nproblems.\\n• Adults and children who have chronic metabolic dis-\\neases, such as diabetes and renal dysfunction, as well\\nas severe anemia or inherited hemoglobin disorders.\\n• Children and teenagers who are on long-term aspirin\\ntherapy .\\n• Anyone who is immunocompromised, including HIV -\\ninfected persons, cancer patients, organ transplant re-\\ncipients, and patients receiving steroids, chemotherapy ,\\nor radiation therapy .\\n• Anyone in contact with the above groups, such as\\nteachers, care givers, health-care personnel, and family\\nmembers.\\n• Travelers to foreign countries.\\nAs of early 2003, researchers are working on devel-\\noping an intranasal flu vaccine in aerosol form.

Ingrown toenails\\nmake up 3–5% of all foot problems. Most cases of in-\\ngrown nail occur in men between the ages of 10–30\\nyears. In this age group, males are affected twice as often\\nas females. In older adults, the incidence is equal. There\\nare three major types of ingrown nail: subcutaneous in-\\ngrown nail, in which the nail grows under the skin; over-\\ncurvature of the nail plate; and hypertrophy (overgrowth)\\nof the lateral nail fold.\\nIngrown nails occur most often on the big toe. Pene-\\ntration of the nail into the skin causes inflammation\\n(swelling and redness). Infection by bacteria or fungi\\nmay follow . Severe infection may lead to abscess forma-\\ntion, characterized by an oozing pus-filled blister. Small\\ntranslucent red bumps called granulation tissue may de-\\nvelop along the lateral nail fold.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nIngrown nails are most commonly caused by incor-\\nrect cutting of the nails and wearing poorly-fitting shoes.\\nOther causes of ingrown nail include:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21080\\nIngrown nail\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nBioterrorism —The intentional use of disease-\\ncausing microbes or other biologic agents to in-\\ntimidate or terrorize a civilian population for po-\\nlitical or military reasons.

It is a cycle with two separate states: rapid eye\\nmovement (REM), the stage in which most dreaming oc-\\ncurs; and non-REM (NREM). Four stages of sleep take\\nplace during NREM: stage I, when the person passes\\nfrom relaxed wakefulness; stage II, an early stage of\\nlight sleep; stages III and IV , which are increasing de-\\ngrees of deep sleep. Most stage IV sleep (also called\\ndelta sleep), occurs in the first several hours of sleep. A\\nperiod of REM sleep normally follows a period of\\nNREM sleep.\\nSleeplessness or insomnia is a symptom and may be\\ncaused by “stress, anxiety , depression , disease, pain ,\\nmedications, sleep disorders, poor sleep habits .. [and]\\nsleep environment and health habits, ” according to the\\nNational Sleep Foundation (NSF).\\nW omen are 1.3 times more likely to report insomnia\\nthan men, according to the NSF . W omen may experience\\nsleeplessness before and at the onset of the menstrual\\ncycle, during pregnancy , and menopause . The founda-\\ntion reported that people over the age of 65 are “more\\nlikely to complain of insomnia than younger people. ”\\nFurthermore, people who are divorced, widowed, or sep-\\narated are more likely to have the problem than those\\nwho are married. In addition, insomnia is more frequent-\\nly reported by those with lower socioeconomic status.\\nInsomnia is classified both by its nightly symptoms\\nand its duration. Sleep-onset insomnia refers to difficulty\\nfalling asleep. Maintenance insomnia refers to waking\\nfrequently during the night or waking early . Insomnia is\\nalso classified in relation to the number of sleepless\\nnights. Short-term or transient insomnia is a common oc-\\ncurrence and usually lasts only a few days. Long-term or\\nchronic insomnia lasts more than three weeks and in-\\ncreases the risk for injuries in the home, at the work-\\nplace, and while driving because of daytime sleepiness\\nand decreased concentration. Chronic insomnia can also\\nlead to mood disorders like depression.\\nInsomnia comes with a high price tag for the nation.\\nNSF in 1999 reported that an estimated $14 billion was\\nspent in one year on such direct costs as insomnia treat-\\nment, healthcare services, and hospital and nursing home\\ncare. Annual indirect costs like work loss, property dam-\\nage from accidents, and transportation to and from\\nhealth care providers were estimated at close to $28 bil-\\nlion. Furthermore, insomnia accounted for $18 billion in\\nlost productivity , according to a 1997 National Sleep\\nFoundation survey .\\nCauses & symptoms\\nTransient insomnia is often caused by a temporary\\nsituation in a person’s life, such as an argument with a\\nloved one, a brief medical illness, or jet lag . When the\\nsituation is resolved or the precipitating factor disap-\\npears, the condition goes away , usually without medical\\ntreatment.\\nSuch prescription drugs as asthma medicine, steroids,\\nand anti-depressants can cause insomnia. Sleeplessness\\nmay also be a side effect of over-the-counter products like\\nnasal decongestants and appetite suppressants.\\nChronic insomnia usually has different causes, and\\nthere may be more than one. These include:\\n• A medical condition or its treatment, including sleep\\napnea, arthritis, a heart condition, and asthma.\\n• Use of such substances as caffeine , alcohol, and nico-\\ntine.\\n• Psychiatric conditions like mood or anxiety disorders.\\n• Stress or depression, such as sadness caused by the\\nloss of a loved one or a job.\\n• Disturbed sleep cycles caused by a change in work\\nshift.\\n• Sleep-disordered breathing, such as snoring.\\n• Periodic jerky leg movements,nocturnal myoclonus,which\\nhappen just as the individual is falling asleep.\\n• Repeated nightmares or panic attacks during sleep.\\nAnother cause is excessive worrying about whether\\nor not a person will be able to fall asleep, which creates\\nso much anxiety that the individual’s bedtime rituals and\\nbehavior actually trigger insomnia. This is called psy-\\nchophysiological insomnia.\\nSymptoms of insomnia\\nPeople who have insomnia do not start the day re-\\nfreshed from a good night’s sleep. They are tired. They may\\nhave difficulty falling asleep, and commonly lie in bed toss-\\ning and turning for hours. Or the individual may go to sleep\\nwithout a problem but wakes in the early hours of the morn-\\ning and is either unable to go back to sleep, or drifts into a\\nrestless, unsatisfying sleep.

The\\nsleep at night is fitful and frequently interrupted.\\nDiagnosis\\nInsomnia, unlike some medical conditions, is easily\\nrecognizable. People know when they aren’t getting\\nenough sleep. The key to treating insomnia is determin-\\ning its causes. Some people can identify sleep-inhibiting\\nfactors such as a death in the family or a hectic work\\nschedule with too much caffeine consumption and not\\nenough exercise. A doctor will take factors such as these\\ninto account when making a diagnosis.\\nThe physician’s diagnosis is based on the patient’s\\nreported signs and symptoms. The doctor may review a\\npatient’s health history or order tests to determine if a\\nmedical condition is causing the insomnia. The physi-\\ncian may ask if the patient is depressed, in pain, under\\nstress, or taking medications, according to the National\\nSleep Foundation. The doctor may ask about disruptions\\nin a patient’s life such as working nontraditional shifts or\\ntraveling across different time zones.\\nIt can be useful for the patient to keep a daily record\\nfor two weeks of sleep patterns, food intake, use of alco-\\nhol, caffeine, nicotine, medications, exercise, and any other\\ninformation recommended by the physician. If the patient\\nhas a bed partner, information can be obtained about\\nwhether the patient snores or is restless during sleep. This\\nrecord, together with a medical history and physical exam-\\nination, can help confirm the doctor’s assessment.\\nA wide variety of healthcare professionals can recog-\\nnize and treat insomnia, but when a patient with chronic\\ninsomnia does not respond to treatment, or the condition\\nis not adequately explained by the patient’s physical, emo-\\ntional, or mental circumstances, then more extensive test-\\ning by a specialist in sleep disorders may be warranted.\\nT reatment\\nIn both alternative and conventional medicine, treat-\\nment of insomnia includes alleviating or coping with any\\nphysical and emotional problems that contribute to the\\ncondition. Also effective is exploration of changes in\\nlifestyle that will improve the situation.\\nChanges in behavior\\nPatients can make changes in their daily routine that\\nare simple and effective in treating insomnia. Eating a\\nhealthy diet rich in calcium, magnesium, and the B vita-\\nmins is also beneficial. A high protein snack like yogurt\\nbefore going to bed is recommended.\\nPatients should go to bed only when sleepy and use\\nthe bedroom only for sleep. Activities like reading, watch-\\ning television, or snacking should take place elsewhere. If\\npeople are unable to go to sleep, they should go into an-\\nother room and do something like reading. People should\\nreturn to bed only when sleepy . Patients should set the\\nalarm and get up every morning at the same time, no mat-\\nter how much they have slept, to establish a regular sleep-\\nwake pattern. Naps during the day should be avoided, but\\nif absolutely necessary , than a 30-minute nap early in the\\nafternoon may not interfere with sleep at night.\\nAnother successful technique is called sleep-restric-\\ntion therapy , restricting the time in bed to the actual time\\nspent sleeping. This approach allows a slight sleep debt\\nto build up, which increases the individual’s ability to\\nfall asleep and stay asleep. If a patient sleeps five hours a\\nnight, the time in bed is limited to 5–5.5 hours. The time\\nin bed is gradually increased in small segments, with the\\nindividual rising at the same time each morning; at least\\n85% of the time in bed must be spent sleeping.\\nMind and body relaxation\\nIncorporating relaxation techniques into bedtime rit-\\nuals helps a person go to sleep faster and improves the\\nquality of sleep. These, alone or in combination with\\nother relaxation techniques, can safely promote sleepi-\\nness. Also effective are massage techniques such as the\\n“cat stroke. ” The masseuse’s hands move gently across\\nthe back. Four other types of stress-reducing bodywork\\nwere recommended in Spontaneous Healing, the book by\\nAndrew W eil, M.D., who practices natural and preventa-\\ntive medicine. W eil recommended Feldenkrais, which in-\\ncludes movements, floor exercises, and body work; Rolf-\\ning, which involves firm pressure; shiatsu, the traditional\\nJapanese form of body work; and Trager work.\\nLearning to substitute pleasant thoughts for unpleas-\\nant ones (imagery training) helps reduce worrying. An-\\nother technique is using audiotapes that combine the\\nsounds of nature with soft relaxing music. Meditation,\\nprayer, and breathing exercises can also be effective.\\nMany alternative treatments are effective in treating\\nboth the symptom of insomnia and its underlying causes.\\nMuch treatment is centered around herbal remedies. The\\nherbs most often recommended for treating insomnia in-\\nclude reishi mushroom, hops, valerian, skullcap, passion\\nflower, lemon balm, ginseng, St. John’s wort, and kava,\\nwhich is also known as kava kava.

Bright\\nlight therapy can be used for people whose insomnia is\\ncaused by jet lag or irregular work shifts. In the morning,\\nthe person is exposed to artificial lamps with a brightness\\nof more than 2,000 lux. The treatment continues with\\navoidance of bright light during the evening.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nA physician may determine that drug therapy is nec-\\nessary to treat insomnia. Drugs may be prescribed if the\\npatient is undergoing a crisis or insomnia persists after a\\npatient has made lifestyle changes. However, drug thera-\\npy is regarded as a short-term remedy , not a solution.\\nConventional medications given for insomnia include\\nsedatives, tranquilizers, and antianxiety drugs. All require\\na doctor’s prescription and may become habit-forming.\\nThey can lose effectiveness over time and can reduce\\nalertness during the day . The medications should be taken\\nup to four times daily or as directed for approximately\\nthree to four weeks. This will vary with the physician, pa-\\ntient, and medication. If insomnia is related to depression,\\nthen an antidepressant medication may be helpful.\\nDrugs prescribed for improving sleep are called\\nhypnotics. This category includes benzodiazepines,\\nwhich are prescribed for anxiety and insomnia. Benzodi-\\nazepines most commonly prescribed for insomnia in-\\nclude Dalmane (fluazepam), Halcion (triazolam), Ativan\\n(lorazepam), Xanax (alprazolam), Restoril (tem-\\npazepam), and Serax (oxazepam).\\nInsomnia is such a widespread problem that “people\\nbuy more over-the-counter and prescription sleeping\\nmedications than any other drug, ” according to CBS\\nHealth W atch.

In its early stages, the condition is\\nasymptomatic, but may develop into T ype II Diabetes.\\nAlthough there are several established risk factors, the\\nunderlying cause is unknown.\\nIt has been estimated that 30 to 33 million Americans\\nare insulin resistant, and the number appears to be increasing.\\nDescription\\nInsulin resistance is initially asymptomatic, and in\\nits early stages can be detected only by laboratory tests.\\nThese tests will show an abnormally high blood sugar\\n(glucose) level, but not high enough to be considered\\nprediabetic or diabetic. While the condition does not al-\\nways lead to further problems, the majority of people\\nwho reach the pre-diabetic level go on to develop T ype II\\nDiabetes (formerly called Maturity Onset Diabetes.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe cause of insulin resistance is unknown, al-\\nthough the condition has been seen to run in families, in-\\ndicating that there is a genetic association. Being over-\\nweight, and lack of exercise are also associated with in-\\nsulin resistance, although the nature of the relationship is\\nnot clear. Risk factors for insulin resistance are:\\n• having a family history of diabetes\\n• having a low HDL (good) cholesterol level—and high\\nserum lipids\\n• having high blood pressure\\n• having a history of diabetes during pregnancy, or hav-\\ning given birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds\\n• being a member of one of the racial groups that appear\\nto have a high incidence of insulin resistance (African\\nAmerican, Native American, Hispanic American/Lati-\\nno, or Asian American/Pacific Islander)\\n• having syndrome X\\n• being obese\\nIn its mildest form, insulin resistance causes no\\nsymptoms, and is only recognizable on laboratory tests.\\nIn more severe cases, there may be dark patches on the\\nback of the neck or even a dark ring around the neck.\\nThe dark patches are called Acanthosis nigricans and\\nmay also cause darkening of skin color in the elbows,\\nknees, knuckles, and armpits.\\nThere is a constellation of symptoms now called\\nmetabolic syndrome or insulin resistance syndrome that\\nis linked to insulin resistance. This syndrome was for-\\nmerly called syndrome X. Metabolic syndrome is de-\\nfined by the National Cholesterol Education Program as\\nthe presence of any three of the following conditions:\\n• excess weight around the waistline (waist measurement\\nof more than 40 inches for men and more than 35 inch-\\nes for women)\\n• high levels of serum triglycerides (150 mg/dL or high-\\ner)\\n• low levels of HDL, or “good, ” cholesterol (below 40\\nmg/dL for men and below 50 mg/dL for women)\\n• high blood pressure (130/85 mm Hg or higher)\\n• high fasting blood glucose levels (110 mg/dL or higher)\\nNote that the numbers are those from an expert\\npanel convened by the National Institutes of Health in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1087\\nInsulin resistance\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1087'),\n",

Other panels of similarly qualified experts have\\ngiven slightly different definitions.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe only means of diagnosis for insulin resistance is\\nlaboratory tests. While there are several tests that may be\\nperformed, the two most common screening tests are the\\nfasting blood sugar test and glucose tolerance test.\\nFasting blood sugar measures the blood glucose level\\nafter a 12-hour fast (no food). A normal level, according\\nto the United Sates National Institute of Diabetes and Di-\\ngestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK), should be below\\n100 mg/dL (milligrams of glucose in every deciliter of\\nblood. A value in the n the 100 to 125 mg/dL range is\\nconsidered evidence of insulin resistance, and is consid-\\nered prediabetic. A value of 126 mg/dL is considered dia-\\nbetic. (Blood sugar levels after a 12 hr fast are typically\\nlower than this, and are controlled by pancreatic insulin\\nsecretion that transports blood glucose out of the blood\\nand into the muscles, brain, organs, and other tissues.)\\nThe glucose tolerance test is performed after the pa-\\ntient has had nothing but water for 10 to 16 hours. The pa-\\ntient has his blood drawn for a a baseline blood glucose\\nlevel. Next, the patient drinks a special sweetened test\\ndrink that contains exactly 75 grams of glucose (pregnant\\nwomen are normally given 100 grams of glucose.) Blood is\\ndrawn again at one-half hour and each of the next six hours\\nto compare blood glucose levels and watch their pattern in\\nresponse to the sweet drink. Normally the blood sugar lev-\\nels is lower before the drink, rises quickly during the first\\nfew hours, and slowly drops again. In insulin resistance,\\nthe blood sugar level rises but stays abnormally high be-\\ncause it is resistant to being removed from blood into tis-\\nsues by insulin. High blood sugar from food or the test glu-\\ncose drink stimulates the pancreas to secrete insulin into\\nthe blood. However, in insulin resistance, the insulin is se-\\ncreted but is only partially absorbed by the tissues. Accord-\\ning to the National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse\\n(NDIC) a normal level would be below 140 mg/dL 2 hours\\nafter the drink. If it is in the 140 to 199 mg/dL range 2\\nhours after drinking the solution, the diagnosis is impaired\\nglucose tolerance (IGT) or prediabetes. A level of 200 or\\nhigher, if confirmed, represents a diagnosis of diabetes.\\nT reatment\\nAmong the most important treatment modalities are\\ndiet and exercise, weight loss if obese, endocrine hor-\\nmone correction if unbalanced. In 2001, the National In-\\nstitutes of Health completed the Diabetes Prevention\\nProgram (DPP), a clinical trial designed to find the most\\neffective ways of preventing type 2 diabetes in over-\\nweight people with prediabetes. The researchers found\\nthat lifestyle changes reduced the risk of diabetes by 58\\npercent. Also, many people with prediabetes showed a\\nreturn to normal blood glucose levels.\\nAccording to the DDP results, a mere half hour of\\nbrisk walking or bicycling five days a week can signifi-\\ncantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Pa-\\ntients should use diet and exercise to reduce their body\\nmass index (BMI) to 25 or below .\\nSmoking has been associated with insulin resis-\\ntance, as well as with some of the more severe problems\\nassociated with diabetes. Discontinuing smoking should\\nbe a top priority .\\nA healthful diet, in addition to assisting in weight\\nloss, may reduce serum lipids and reduce some of the risk\\nfactors for diabetes. One study recommended the\\nMediterranean diet as being the most beneficial for peo-\\nple with insulin resistance. Diet improvements include re-\\nducing sweets, desserts and high glycemic meals; eating\\nbalanced meals that contain protein, complex carbohy-\\ndrates, fiber, greens and healthy oils, eating at regular\\ntimes, and avoiding excess junk food and sugar.\\nNo complimentary or alternative therapies have been\\nproven to cure insulin resistance. Although several herbal\\nremedies have been traditionally used for treatment of dia-\\nbetes, none have been adequately documented as effective.\\nAmong medicinal plants shown to help lower elevated blood\\nsugar are the Asian bitter melon and the Navaho Optunia\\ncactus. Such herbal bitters as dandelion root and yellow\\ndock can improve digestive strength and sometimes help,\\nthough no herbal remedy alone “cures” insulin resistance or\\ndiabetes. Guar gum, glucomannan, and psyllium seed all\\nhave demonstrated some ability to lower blood sugar in in-\\nsulin resistance or diabetes, but none have been shown to be\\nreliably effective for use in treatment of humans.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nInsulin resistance does not normally require drug\\ntherapy; however, some studies have shown that the\\ndrugs used to treat type 2 diabetes may delay develop-\\nment of diabetes. T wo classes of drugs now used to treat\\ndiabetes act by increasing insulin sensitivity , the\\nbiguanides and the thiazolidinediones; the other drugs\\nused to treat diabetes act in different ways.\\nAlthough drugs from both classes have been effec-\\ntive in treatment of insulin resistance, neither drug has\\nbeen as effective as a regimen of diet and exercise. Both\\nclasses of drugs have the potential for very severe ad-\\nverse effects.They are also not approved by the FDA for\\ncontrol of insulin resistance, although physicians may\\nprescribe them for this use if the condition appears to be\\ngetting worse without drug therapy .

Iodine is\\nalso needed for the production of thyroid hormones. The\\nthyroid (a small gland in the front of the neck), which\\ncontains 80% of the body’s iodine pool, converts iodine\\ninto the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T\\n4) and triiodothy-\\nronine (T3). These hormones are released into the blood-\\nstream, controlling the body’s metabolism.\\nGeneral use\\nAs established by the National Research Council’s\\nFood and Nutrition Board, the revised 1989 Recommend-\\ned Dietary Allowance (RDA) for iodine is 40 mcg for in-\\nfants, increasing to 150 mcg for adults and children age 11\\nand older. The RDA for pregnant and lactating women in-\\ncreases to 175 and 200 mcg respectively . Harrison’s Prin-\\nciples of Internal Medicine reports that average U.S. io-\\ndine daily intake ranges from approximately 0.5–1.0 mg.\\nAccording to the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Thera-\\npy, less than 20 mcg per day of iodide results in iodine de-\\nficiency; iodide intake 20 times greater than the daily re-\\nquirement (2 mg) results in chronic iodine toxicity .\\nIodine is available from a variety of food sources,\\ndrugs, and most commercial vitamin preparations. Some\\nseafood and sea vegetables provide good sources of di-\\netary iodine, including: canned sardines, canned tuna,\\nclams, cod, haddock, halibut, herring, lobster, oyster,\\nperch, salmon, sea bass, and shrimp. Dulse, kelp , and\\nseaweed are also sources of dietary iodine. If grown in\\niodine-rich soil, foods including asparagus, green pep-\\npers, lettuce, lima beans, mushrooms, pineapple, raisins,\\nspinach, summer squash, Swiss chard, turnip greens, and\\nwhole wheat bread may provide good sources of dietary\\niodine. Animal products can also provide a source of io-\\ndine, especially if the animals are fed iodine-enriched\\nfoods or salt: beef, beef liver, butter, cheddar cheese, cot-\\ntage cheese, cream, eggs, lamb, milk, and pork. Some\\nfoods such as breads may contain iodine additives.\\nAnother source of dietary iodine is iodized salt.\\nIodized table salt was introduced in the United States in\\n1924 and significantly reduced the incidence of iodine defi-\\nciency . Providing iodized salt licks for livestock adds iodine\\nto animal products. In some parts of the world, iodized oil\\nsupplements and water iodination provide other means of\\niodine supplementation. Many countries, however, still have\\ninsufficient iodine supplementation programs.\\nIodine has several medical applications. T ypically ,\\nin conjunction with drug therapy , iodine may be used to\\ntreat goiter (an enlargement of the thyroid gland), symp-\\ntoms of hypothyroidism (diminished production of thy-\\nroid hormone), and hyperthyroidism (increased produc-\\ntion of the thyroid gland). It may also be used as an ex-\\npectorant in cough medications. Applications of iodine\\nto conditions including arteriosclerosis, arthritis, and\\nangina pectoris have also been noted. Iodine tinctures\\n(dilute mixtures of alcohol and iodine) or Betadine are\\nused as antiseptics to kill bacteria in skin cuts. Atomi-\\ndine (a product containing iodine trichloride and other\\nunlisted ingredients) is also sold as an antiseptic. Atomi-\\ndine taken orally in minute cyclic doses is also recom-\\nmended as a glandular stimulant and purifier.\\nSome research has shown that oral iodine supple-\\nments have antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects.\\nCommonly reported studies have also suggested that io-\\ndine deficiency may be a factor in fibrocystic breast dis-\\nease (FBD), a catch-all term that describes general, often\\nnormal, lumpiness of the breast. Clinical trials on women\\ndiagnosed with FBD found that, even in women showing\\nnormal thyroid function, thyroid hormone supplementa-\\ntion produced results including decreased breast pain and\\ndecreased breast nodules. Some early research also corre-\\nlated higher incidence of breast, endometrial, and ovarian\\ncancers with hypothyroidism and/or iodine deficiency .\\nHowever, others have noted that low levels of selenium,\\nwhich is more classically associated with cancer , were\\nalso present in the women in these studies.\\nIodine is used in several compounds for a variety of\\nmedical testing. For example, it may be used in x-rays of\\nthe gallbladder or kidneys or in cardiac imaging. It is used\\nas a diagnostic tool to examine the thyroid gland’s output.\\nA common test measures thyroid radioactive iodine up-\\ntake (RAIU). Trace amounts of radioactive iodine (I\\n123 or\\nI131) are used to test thyroid function. T ogether with blood\\ntests, examining how much iodine is taken up by the thy-\\nroid gland helps physicians diagnose hypothyroid condi-\\ntions (when the thyroid takes up too little iodine) and hy-\\nperthyroid conditions (when it takes up too much). Ra-\\ndioactive iodine therapy is also used for treating thyroid\\ndisease and cancer. Radioactive iodine can cross the pla-\\ncenta, causing severe dysfunction and damage to the\\nfetus’s thyroid gland. Current Medical Diagnosis and\\nTreatment 2000notes that nursing mothers should discon-\\ntinue nursing for a period of time after receiving test or\\ntreatment doses of radioactive iodine. One study published\\nin the Journal of the American Medical Association\\n(JAMA) in May 2000 reported radiation exposure to fami-\\nly members of non-pregnant, non-nursing outpatients\\nfrom I\\n131 treatment to be well below limits mandated by\\nU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) guidelines.\\nMedical professionals may also prescribe low iodine diets\\nin combination with radioactive iodine tests or treatments.\\nPrecautions\\nT oo much or too little iodine intake results in a wide\\nspectrum of disorders that are addressed by adjusting io-\\ndine intake.

Nowadays, ipecac is used to treat a\\nvariety of conditions. Its most widely accepted use is to\\ninduce vomiting in cases of accidental poisoning. When\\nipecac is swallowed, a substance in it called cephaeline\\nirritates the stomach and causes vomiting. Syrup of\\nipecac is now considered the safest drug to treat poison-\\ning and is often the most effective. There are different\\ntypes of ipecac preparations that vary greatly in strength.\\nSyrup of ipecac is best for use at home to treat accidental\\npoisoning. Ipecac fluid extract and ipecac tincture should\\nbe avoided, as they are much stronger compounds and\\ncan be toxic.\\nIpecacuanha is a homeopathic remedy made from\\nipecac by a process of dilution and succussion (shaking). In\\ncontrast to syrup of ipecac, it is given to relieve vomiting.\\nGeneral use\\nT reatment of poisoning\\nStandard medical practice uses ipecac to cause vom-\\niting in cases of poisoning in order to remove the toxic\\nsubstance from the stomach before absorption occurs. It\\ncan be used on animals as well as humans. Ipecac is\\nsafer and more effective than many other methods for in-\\nducing vomiting, such as sticking a finger down a child’s\\nthroat or using saltwater. There are times, however, when\\nipecac should not be used because it can make certain\\nkinds of poisoning worse. Syrup of ipecac should not be\\nused if the poison is one of the following.\\n• strychnine\\n• alkalis (lye)\\n• strong acids\\n• kerosene\\n• fuel oil\\n• gasoline\\n• coal oil\\n• paint thinner\\n• cleaning fluid\\nPoisoning is a potentially serious condition. It is\\nbest to contact a local poison control center, local hospi-\\ntal emergency room, or the family doctor for instructions\\nbefore using syrup of ipecac.\\nIpecac’s reputation for inducing vomiting has en-\\ncouraged some bulimics to take it on a regular basis in\\norder to purge the contents of the stomach after an eating\\nbinge. This misuse of ipecac is extremely dangerous; it\\ncan cause heart problems, tears in the esophagus or\\nstomach lining, vomiting blood, seizures, or even death.\\nHomeopathy\\nThe homeopathic remedy made from ipecac is\\ncalled Ipecacuanha. Homeopathic preparations are given\\nfor a reason completely opposite from that of standard\\nallopathic treatment. In homeopathy , ipecac is given to\\nstop vomiting rather than to induce it. According to Hah-\\nnemann’s law of similars, a substance that would cause\\nvomiting in large doses when given to a healthy person\\nwill stimulate a sick person’s natural defenses when\\ngiven in extremely diluted and carefully prepared doses.\\nIpecacuanha is a favorite homeopathic remedy for\\nmorning sickness associated with pregnancy. It is also\\ngiven to stop nausea that is not relieved by vomiting;\\nwhen the vomitus is slimy and white; when there is gag-\\nging and heavy salivation; when the tongue is clean de-\\nspite the patient’s feelings of nausea; and when the pa-\\ntient is not thirsty . The nausea may be accompanied by a\\nheadache , cough , or heavy menstrual bleeding. The\\nmodalities (circumstances) that suggest Ipecacuanha as\\nthe appropriate homeopathic remedy is that the patient\\nfeels worse lying down; in dry weather; in winter; and\\nwhen exercising or moving about.\\nA homeopathic practitioner would not necessarily\\nprescribe ipecac for all cases of nausea. Arsenicum\\nwould be given when the nausea is caused by food poi-\\nsoning and accompanied by strong thirst, Nux vomica\\nwhen the nausea is the result of overindulgence in food\\nor alcohol and accompanied by gas or heartburn. A sick\\nchild might be given Pulsatilla, particularly if rich foods\\nhave been eaten.\\nOn the other hand, a homeopathic practitioner may\\nprescribe ipecac for any of the following conditions that\\nare not related to nausea and vomiting.\\n• nosebleeds producing bright red blood\\n• dental bleeding\\n• diarrhea with cramping abdominal pain. The stools are\\ngreen with froth or foam.\\n• Asthma of sudden onset. The patient has to sit up in\\norder to breathe, but cannot bring up any mucus in spite\\nof violent coughing.\\n• hoarseness or loss of voice following a cold\\n• physical or mental exhaustion\\nPreparations\\nSyrup of ipecac\\nSyrup of ipecac is made from the dried roots and\\nrhizomes (underground stems) of Cephaelis ipecacuan-\\nha.

Odle\\nIpraflavone see Ipriflavone\\nIpriflavone\\nDescription\\nIpriflavone (IP), also called ipraflavone, is a mass-\\nproduced synthetic derivative of genistein (genistin) or\\ndaidzein. Genistein and daidzein are unique plant com-\\npounds called isoflavones, which are primarily found in\\nsoy products. Isoflavones belong to a larger category\\nknown as flavonoids, which are natural plant compo-\\nnents that have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory , anti-al-\\nlergy , and anticancer properties. Although most soy\\nisoflavones are classified as plant estrogens (phytoestro-\\ngens), ipriflavone does not have estrogenic activity , and\\ndoes not activate any estrogen receptors in the body .\\nHowever, it may prevent or treat bone loss—osteoporo-\\nsis—associated with menopause (the cessation of men-\\nstruation) and aging.\\nIpriflavone contains three carbon rings. Its chemical\\nnames are:\\n• 7-isopropoxyisoflavone\\n• 7-isopropoxy-3-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one\\n• 7-(1-methylethoxy)-3-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one\\n• 7-isopropoxy-3-phenylchromone\\nOne source notes that ipriflavone is found in foods,\\nbut only in trace amounts. In addition to soy products (in-\\ncluding some soy sauces), trace amounts are found in al-\\nfalfa and other foods. It is also found in propolis, a resin\\nthat bees collect from tree buds for use as a hive cement.\\nIpriflavone is a solid that dissolves only slightly in water.\\nThe liver metabolizes ipriflavone into 7-hydroxy-\\nipriflavone and 7-(1-carboxy-ethoxy)-isoflavone. IP and\\nits derivatives are bound to albumin, a blood protein, and\\ndistributed to tissues throughout the body .\\nIpriflavone may be one of the best-studied com-\\npounds in the natural health industry . However, the re-\\nsults of these studies are not clear with regard to efficacy\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21094\\nIpriflavone\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nBulimia nervosa —An eating disorder character-\\nized by episodic binge eating followed by self-in-\\nduced vomiting or laxative abuse.\\nCephaeline —A chemical compound found in\\nipecac that irritates the stomach lining and triggers\\nthe vomiting reflex.\\nFluid extract —A concentrated preparation of a\\ndrug.\\nLaw of similars —A principle of homeopathic\\ntreatment according to which substances that\\ncause specific symptoms in healthy people are\\ngiven to sick people with similar symptoms.\\nModality —A factor or circumstance that makes a\\npatient’ s symptoms better or worse.

Since the 1980s, it has been a registered pre-\\nscription drug for the prevention and treatment of osteo-\\nporosis in Japan, Argentina, and Europe.\\nGeneral use\\nLike other cells in the human body , bone cells are\\nconstantly being replaced. Furthermore, bones serve as a\\ncalcium bank because they are a source of calcium used\\nfor other functions, such as buffering the blood. Osteo-\\nporosis is a net loss of bone mass, caused either by ex-\\ncessive bone-resorping (dissolving) or low bone-forming\\nactivities. These activities are often related to the in-\\ncreased bone turnover rate that accompanies menopause.\\nW omen have a lifetime risk of 40% for developing\\nosteoporosis. One-half of all women over the age of 50\\nwill develop the disease. One in eight men experience\\nbone fractures as a result of osteoporosis. Hip fractures\\ncaused by osteoporosis are a direct or indirect cause of\\ndeath in one-quarter of elderly Americans. Bone building\\nand breakdown are influenced by the following:\\n• hormones, including estrogen and calcitonin (from the\\nparathyroid gland)\\n• such minerals as magnesium , phosphorus , boron ,\\nzinc, silica, and vanadium\\n• vitamins, including vitamin D.\\n• such other factors as corticosteroid use, sunlight, di-\\netary acidity , physiologic pH, and overall bodily health\\nNumerous studies have indicated that ipriflavone\\nmaintains or increases bone mineral density in osteo-\\nporosis, particularly in conjunction with calcium supple-\\nmentation. Clinical studies have demonstrated that ipri-\\nflavone supplementation may:\\n• prevent rapid bone loss immediately following\\nmenopause\\n• increase bone density in postmenopausal women by as\\nmuch as 3%\\n• increase bone mineral density in women with osteo-\\nporosis by up to 6%\\n• decrease the incidence of bone fractures among post-\\nmenopausal women\\n• reduce bone pain caused by osteoporosis\\n• increase mobility in women with osteoporosis\\n• stimulate the synthesis and secretion of calcitonin, a\\nhormone that controls calcium metabolism\\n• lower the high cholesterol levels associated with\\nmenopausal estrogen deficiency\\n• have some activity against cancer\\nIpriflavone also slows bone loss in women whose\\novaries have been removed, although it does not appear\\nto prevent acute bone loss immediately following\\novariectomy . Further studies in this area have not ob-\\ntained the same conclusions, except under very specific\\nconditions including younger age and active bone loss.\\nTherefore, the presence of osteoporosis alone does not\\nappear to be sufficient for obtaining good results, even\\nwith calcium supplementation.\\nThe mechanisms of ipriflavone activity are not un-\\nderstood. In vitro and animal studies have indicated that:\\n• Genistein inhibits the breakdown of bone.\\n• Ipriflavone inhibits bone resorption (the breakdown\\nand recycling of bone tissue).\\n• Ipriflavone may stimulate bone formation.\\nIn contrast, one large study of postmenopausal\\nwomen with slight osteoporosis found no significant bone\\ndensity changes between the group taking calcium sup-\\nplements alone and those taking calcium plus ipriflavone.\\nSince ipriflavone does not have estrogenic activity ,\\nit may be appropriate for treating bone loss in men, par-\\nticularly in those with prostate cancer who are receiv-\\ning therapies that reduce androgen (masculinizing hor-\\nmone) levels.\\nPreparations\\nIpriflavone is available over-the-counter (OTC) in\\nmany generic and brand name forms (e.g. Ostivone, Na-\\ntrol, and Bone Support Ipriflavone Blend). It is supplied\\nin capsules, each containg 100, 200, or 300 mg. A typi-\\ncal IP dose for the management of osteoporosis is 200\\nmg, two to three times daily .

The medical school of the University of Salerno in\\nItaly offered training in iris diagnosis. A book published\\nby Philippus Meyers in 1670, called Chiromatica medica,\\nnoted that signs in the iris indicate diseases. Dr. Ignatz\\nvon Peczely , however, is generally considered the father\\nof iridology , with the date of his discovery given as 1861.\\nV on Peczely was a Hungarian physician. As a child, he\\naccidentally broke an owl’s leg. He observed that a black\\nline formed in the owl’s lower iris at the time of the in-\\njury . After the owl’s leg healed, the young von Peczely\\nnoted that the black streak had changed appearance. As a\\nphysician, he treated a patient with a broken leg in whose\\neye he observed a black streak in the same location as on\\nthe injured owl’s iris. V on Peczely became intrigued by\\nthe possibility of a connection between diseases and eye\\nmarkings. Through observing his patients’ eyes, he be-\\ncame convinced of this connection and developed a chart\\nthat mapped iris-body correlations. After several decades\\nof comparative study , von Peczely mapped organs across\\nzones identified by hours and minutes on a clock face su-\\nperimposed over drawings of the eyes. In 1881, he pub-\\nlished his theories in a book called Discoveries in the\\nField of Natural Science and Medicine: Instruction in the\\nStudy of Diagnosis from the Eye.\\nA Swedish pastor and homeopath named Nils Lil-\\njequist also developed the concept of iris-body correla-\\ntions at roughly the same time but independently of von\\nPeczely’s work. He was the first iridologist to identify\\nthe effects of such drugs as iodine and quinine on the\\niris. Liljequist based his initial observations on changes\\nin his own irises after illnesses and injuries, publishing\\nwritings and eye drawings during the late nineteenth\\ncentury . One of his students, Dr. Henry Lahn, brought\\nthe practice of iridology to the United States. A variety\\nof practitioners, primarily European, have sought to pop-\\nularize iridology since these early works. Dr. Bernard\\nJensen, a chiropractor, is the best-known contemporary\\nAmerican advocate of iridology .\\nBenefits\\nIridologists claim that by studying the patterns of a\\nperson’s iris, they can provide helpful and accurate\\nhealth and wellness information. Iridology is a holistic\\nendeavor in that it addresses the person’s whole being in\\nthe reading. The range of information gleaned encom-\\npasses physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects\\nof the person’s health picture. In addition to assessing\\nthe person’s general level of health, readings can reveal\\nother data, including energy quotients; internal areas of\\nirritation, degeneration, injury , or inflammation; nutri-\\nOTHER\\nBrown, Susan E.

Iridologists\\nmaintain that the eyes reveal information about the per-\\nson’s physical and emotional constitution, such as inher-\\nited weaknesses and risks to which the person may be\\nprone. Strengths may also be revealed, including inherit-\\ned emotional tendencies from which the person derives\\nparticular talents. Cleansing and healing can be verified\\nby changes in the iris.

It may , iridologists claim, reveal\\nthat organs or systems are overstressed or predisposed to\\ndisease before clinical symptoms even develop. By pre-\\ndicting future problems, iridology can be used as a pre-\\nventive tool.

Although iridol-\\nogists may differ on the exact mechanism, most maintain\\nthat the iris reflects what is happening throughout the\\nbody via nerve conduction from all parts of the body to\\nthe eye. The client’s health is assessed by the iridologist,\\nwho interprets patterns, shapes, rings, colors and pig-\\nmentation markings, fibers, structures, and changes in\\nthe pupil and iris. Many iridologists also use sclerology\\n(reading the lines in the white part of the eyes) in their\\nhealth evaluation.\\nIridology readings are typically performed by such\\nholistically oriented practitioners as naturopaths, chiroprac-\\ntors, or nutritionists. The reading may be done using a\\nbright light, a magnifying glass, and a notepad. The iridolo-\\ngist may also use various tools to better view the eye, a spe-\\ncial camera to take pictures of the iris, and/or a computer.\\nIridologists conduct their readings using charts on\\nwhich each area of the iris is mapped to a specific body\\nsystem or organ. Iridology charts vary , with at least 20\\ndifferent ones in existence. Some charts are more widely\\nused than others; however, many iridologists believe that\\nthere is more than one correct map and that each practi-\\ntioner should become familiar with several charts. Some\\niridologists even develop their own charts. Differences\\nalso exist among practitioner techniques; among Ameri-\\ncan, European, and other approaches; and in the interpre-\\ntation of specific iris signs.\\nIridology charts divide the iris into numerous zones\\ncorresponding to different parts of the body . Although\\nthe specifics may differ on each chart, all share a general\\npattern. The left eye is mapped to the left side of the\\nbody and the right eye to the right side. The top of the\\neye is mapped to the upper body (e.g., brain, face, neck,\\nchest and heart). The center of the eye is mapped to the\\nstomach and digestive organs, with other organs being\\nrepresented by concentric circular zones moving out-\\nward toward the edge of the iris. The bottom of the eye is\\nmapped to the legs and lower half of body . Paired organs\\n(e.g., the kidneys) are mapped to both irises.\\nUsing a holistic approach that considers each client\\nas an individual with unique health patterns and con-\\ncerns, behaviors, and experiences, the iridologist will ex-\\namine the eyes and make a health assessment. Based on\\nthe results of that reading, the iridologist generally rec-\\nommends a wellness program tailored to the individual’s\\nphysical, emotional, and life situation. This program\\nmay incorporate various health improvement, mainte-\\nnance, and prevention regimes. Recommendations may\\ninclude vitamins, minerals, herbs, supplements, and/or\\ndiet and nutrition, among other suggestions.\\nPreparation\\nNo special preparations are necessary before an iri-\\ndology reading.\\nPrecautions\\nAn iridology reading is unlikely to cause any physi-\\ncal harm by itself, as it does not involve direct contact\\nwith the eye or applying eye drops of any kind. Critics of\\niridology , however, argue that iridology can be detrimen-\\ntal to health if a sick person delays treatment for a condi-\\ntion not suggested by the iridology reading; or that it can\\ncan cause anguish and unnecessary expense if a reading\\nsuggests a problem when there actually is none.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nRita M.

There is no recognized cure for IBS. Much\\nabout the condition remains unknown or poorly under-\\nstood; however, dietary changes, drugs, and psychologi-\\ncal treatment are often able to eliminate or substantially\\nreduce its symptoms.\\nDescription\\nIBS is the name people use today for a condition that\\nwas once called colitis, spastic colon, nervous colon, spas-\\ntic bowel, and functional bowel disorder. Some of these\\nnames reflected the now-outdated belief that IBS is a\\npurely psychological disorder and a product of the pa-\\ntient’s imagination. Although modern medicine recog-\\nnizes that stress can trigger IBS attacks, medical special-\\nists agree that IBS is a genuine physical disorder or group\\nof disorders with specific identifiable characteristics.\\nNo one knows for sure how many Americans suffer\\nfrom IBS. Surveys indicate a range of 10-20%, with per-\\nhaps as many as 30% of Americans experiencing IBS at\\nsome point in their lives. IBS normally makes its first ap-\\npearance during young adulthood, and in half of all cases,\\nsymptoms begin before age 35.

Other symptoms, which vary from per-\\nson to person, include cramps, gassiness, bloating, nausea, a\\npowerful and uncontrollable urge to defecate (urgency),\\npassage of a sticky fluid (mucus) during bowel movements,\\nor the feeling after finishing a bowel movement that the\\nbowels are still not completely empty . The accepted diag-\\nnostic criteria, known as the Rome criteria, require at least\\nthree months of continuous or recurrent symptoms before\\nIBS is diagnosed. According to Christine B. Dalton and\\nDouglas A. Drossman in the American F amily Physician,\\nan estimated 70% of IBS cases can be described as “mild”;\\n25% as “moderate”; and 5% as “severe. ” In mild cases the\\nsymptoms are slight. As a general rule, they are not present\\nall the time and do not interfere with work and other normal\\nactivities. Moderate IBS disrupts normal activities and may\\ncause some psychological problems. People with severe\\nIBS may constantly fear the unpredictable need for a bath-\\nroom. They often find living a normal life impossible and\\nexperience crippling psychological problems as a result.\\nFor some, the physical pain is constant and intense.\\nCauses\\nResearchers remain unsure about the cause or caus-\\nes of IBS. It is called a functional disorder because it is\\nthought to result from changes in the activity of the\\nmajor part of the large intestine (the colon). After food is\\ndigested by the stomach and small intestine, the undi-\\ngested material passes in liquid form into the colon,\\nwhich absorbs water and salts. This process may take\\nseveral days. In a healthy person the colon is quiet dur-\\ning most of that period except after meals, when its mus-\\ncles contract in a series of wavelike movements called\\nperistalsis. Peristalsis helps absorption by bringing the\\nundigested material into contact with the colon wall. It\\nalso pushes undigested material that has been converted\\ninto solid or semisolid feces toward the rectum, where it\\nremains until defecation. In IBS, however, the normal\\nrhythm and intensity of peristalsis is disrupted. Some-\\ntimes there is too little peristalsis, which can slow the\\npassage of undigested material through the colon and\\ncause constipation. Sometimes there is too much, which\\nhas the opposite effect and causes diarrhea. A Johns\\nHopkins University study found that healthy volunteers\\nexperienced six to eight contractions of the colon each\\nday , compared with up to 25 contractions a day for vol-\\nunteers suffering from IBS with diarrhea, and an almost\\ncomplete absence of contractions among constipated\\nIBS volunteers. In addition to differences in the number\\nof contractions, many of the IBS volunteers experienced\\npowerful spasmodic contractions affecting a larger-than-\\nnormal area of the colon—“like having a Charlie horse\\nin the gut, ” according to one of the investigators.\\nDIET . Some kinds of food and drink appear to play a\\nkey role in triggering IBS attacks. Food and drink that\\nhealthy people can ingest without any trouble may dis-\\nrupt peristalsis in IBS patients, which probably explains\\nwhy IBS attacks often occur shortly after meals. Choco-\\nlate, milk products, caffeine (in coffee, tea, colas, and\\nother drinks), and large quantities of alcohol are some of\\nthe chief culprits. Other kinds of food have also been\\nidentified as problems, however, and the pattern of what\\ncan and cannot be tolerated is different for each person.\\nCharacteristically , IBS symptoms rarely occur at night\\nand disrupt the patient’s sleep.\\nIn 2002 a research study reported that some children\\nhad trouble absorbing certain sugars from some fruit\\njuices, particularly apple and pear juices. When children\\nwith IBS went off these juices for one month, 46% saw\\nimprovement in their IBS symptoms. Apple and pear\\njuice contain more fructose than glucose sugar, which\\nmay be the cause of the poor absorption in IBS sufferers’\\nintestines. Y et white grape juice, which contains almost\\nequal portions of fructose and glucose, is more easily ab-\\nsorbed.\\nSTRESS. Stress is an important factor in IBS because\\nof the close nervous system connections between the\\nbrain and the intestines. Although researchers do not yet\\nunderstand all of the links between changes in the ner-\\nvous system and IBS, they point out the similarities be-\\ntween mild digestive upsets and IBS. Just as healthy peo-\\nple can feel nauseated or have an upset stomach when\\nunder stress, people with IBS react the same way , but to\\na greater degree. Finally , IBS symptoms sometimes in-\\ntensify during menstruation, which suggests that female\\nreproductive hormones are another trigger. In fact, a\\nstudy published in 2002 confirmed that IBS symptoms\\nworsened in women and that rectal sensitivity changed\\nwith the menstrual cycle in women with IBS. It also was\\nthe first study to contrast these changes with those in\\nhealthy women.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosing IBS is a fairly complex task because the\\ndisorder does not produce changes that can be identified\\nduring a physical examination or by laboratory tests.\\nWhen IBS is suspected, the doctor (a family doctor or a\\nspecialist) needs to determine whether the patient’s\\nsymptoms satisfy the Rome criteria. The doctor rules out\\nother conditions that resemble IBS, such as Crohn’s dis-\\nease and ulcerative colitis. These disorders are ruled out\\nby taking a standard medical history , performing a physi-\\ncal examination, and ordering laboratory tests.

The\\ndoctor can then review the diary with the patient to iden-\\ntify possible problem areas.\\nT reatment\\nDietary adjustments are critical to controlling IBS.\\nFor some patients, a high-fiber diet including whole\\ngrain breads and cereals, dried and fresh fruits, spinach,\\nand oat bran can reduce digestive system irritation. For\\nothers, a high-fiber diet aggravates the symptoms. Many\\npatients with IBS also find that avoiding alcohol, caf-\\nfeine, sugar, and fatty ,gas-producing, or spicy foods can\\nprevent symptoms.\\nT o control IBS symptoms that are triggered or made\\nworse by stress, several stress management therapies\\nmay be helpful. These include yoga, meditation, hypno-\\nsis, biofeedback , exercise , muscle relaxation training,\\naromatherapy, hydrotherapy, and reflexology. Reflex-\\nology is a foot massage technique that focuses on manip-\\nulating different regions of the foot in order to bring har-\\nmony to specific organs and body systems. Hydrothera-\\npy is the therapeutic use of water, as in a whirlpool bath.\\nBiofeedback, which teaches an individual to control\\nmuscle tension and any associated pain through thought\\nand visualization techniques, is also a treatment option\\nfor IBS. In biofeedback treatments, sensors placed on the\\nforehead of the patient are connected to a special machine\\nthat allows the patient and healthcare professional to\\nmonitor a visual and/or audible readout of the level of\\nmuscle tension and stress in the patient. Through relax-\\nation and visualization exercises, the patient learns to re-\\nlieve tension and can actually see or hear the results of his\\nor her efforts instantly through a sensor readout on the\\nbiofeedback equipment. Once the technique is learned\\nand the patient is able to recognize and differentiate be-\\ntween the feelings of muscle tension and muscle relax-\\nation, the biofeedback equipment itself is no longer need-\\ned and the patient has a powerful, portable, and self-ad-\\nministered treatment tool to deal with pain and tension.\\nT o soothe an irritated or inflamed digestive tract, an\\nherbalist or holistic healthcare practitioner may recom-\\nmend one or more herbs, including comfrey root ( Sym-\\nphytum officinale ), hops (Humulus lupulus ), Iceland\\nmoss (Cetraria islandica ), Irish moss ( Chondrus\\ncrispus ), marsh mallow root ( Althaea officinalis ), oats\\n(Avena sativa), quince seed (Cydonia oblonga), and slip-\\npery elm (Ulmus rubra).\\nHerbs that relieve gas associated with IBS (known\\nas carminatives) include angelica (Angelica archangeli-\\nca), aniseed ( Pimpinella anisum ), caraway ( Carum\\ncarvi ), cayenne (Capsicum annuum ), German\\nchamomile (Matricaria recutita ), ginger (Zingiber of-\\nficinale ), thyme (Thymus vulgaris ), and peppermint\\n(Menthapiperata ).\\nAn infusion of meadowsweet ( Filipendula ulmaria )\\nmay be helpful in treating diarrhea related to IBS, and\\nherbs such as barberry\\n(Berberis vulgaris ), psyllium\\novata seed,dandelion root (T araxacum officinale), licorice\\n(Glycyrrhiza glabra ), and yellow dock (Rumex crispus )\\nhave laxative properties that can help to relieve constipa-\\ntion. More powerful laxative herbs, such as rhubarb root\\n(Rheum palmatum ), buckthorn (Rhamnus catharticus ),\\nand cascara ( Rhamnus purshiana ) should only be taken\\nunder the direction of a healthcare professional.\\nIndividuals with cramp-like pains, or colic, can ben-\\nefit from antispasmodic herbs such as German\\nchamomile ( Matricaria recutita ), V alerian (V aleriana\\nofficinalis ), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis ), ginger\\n(Zingiber officinale), and wild yam (Dioscorea villosa).\\nHomeopathy uses highly-diluted remedies that\\ncause similar effects to the symptoms they are intended\\nto treat in an effort to stimulate the body’s natural im-\\nmune response. A homeopathic physician might recom-\\nmend a remedy of belladonna , colocynthis (bitter cu-\\ncumber), phosphate of magnesia (Magnesia phosphori-\\nca), or wild hops ( Bryonia alba ) to relieve abdominal\\npain and cramping associated with IBS. As with all\\nhomeopathic remedies, the prescription depends on the\\nindividual’s overall symptoms, mood, and temperament.\\nAcupuncture and guided imagery may be useful\\ntools in treating IBS symptoms. Acupuncture involves\\nthe placement of thin needles into the skin at targeted lo-\\ncations on the body known as acupoints in order to har-\\nmonize the energy flow within the human body . An\\nacupuncturist may also use moxibustion, which involves\\napplying a heat source such as warm herbs to the acu-\\npoint, to treat IBS symptoms. Guided imagery tech-\\nniques teach the patient to visualize a peaceful, soothing\\nscene or situation to relax the body and better cope with\\nthe discomfort caused by IBS.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nDietary changes, sometimes supplemented by drugs\\nor psychotherapy , are considered the key to successful\\ntreatment. A drug called alosetron (Lotronex) was ap-\\nproved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in\\n2002 for limited marketing for treating women with diar-\\nrhea-prominent IBS after some controversy in 2000 be-\\ncause of serious side effects from the drug.

Ischemia oc-\\ncurs when there is an insufficient supply of blood to a spe-\\ncific organ or tissue. (Photograph by Dr. P . Marazzi, Photo\\nResearchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)\\nIschemia\\nDefinition\\nIschemia is an insufficient supply of oxygenated\\nblood to an organ, usually due to a blocked artery .\\nDescription\\nMyocardial ischemia is an intermediate condition in\\ncoronary artery disease during which the heart tissue is\\nslowly or suddenly starved of oxygen and other nutri-\\nents. Eventually , the affected heart tissue will die. When\\nblood flow is completely blocked to the heart, ischemia\\ncan lead to a heart attack . Ischemia can be silent or\\nsymptomatic. According to the American Heart Associa-\\ntion, up to four million Americans may have silent is-\\nchemia and be at high risk of having a heart attack with\\nno warning.\\nSymptomatic ischemia is characterized by chest\\npain called angina pectoris. The American Heart Asso-\\nciation estimates that nearly seven million Americans\\nhave angina pectoris, usually called angina. Angina oc-\\ncurs more frequently in women than in men, and more\\noften in African-Americans and Hispanics than in Cau-\\ncasians. It also occurs more frequently as people age—\\n25% of women over the age of 85 and 27% of men be-\\ntween 80 and 84 years of age have angina.\\nPeople with angina are at risk of having a heart at-\\ntack. Stable angina occurs during exertion, can be quick-\\nly relieved by resting or taking nitroglycerine, and lasts\\nfrom three to 20 minutes. Unstable angina, which in-\\ncreases the risk of a heart attack, occurs more frequently ,\\nlasts longer, is more severe, and may cause discomfort\\nduring rest or light exertion.\\nIschemia also can occur in the arteries of the brain,\\nwhere blockages can lead to a stroke. About 80–85% of\\nall strokes are ischemic. Most blockages in the cerebral\\narteries are due to a blood clot, often in an artery nar-\\nrowed by plaque. Sometimes, a blood clot in the heart or\\naorta travels to a cerebral artery . A transient ischemic at-\\ntack (TIA) is a “mini-stroke” caused by a temporary de-\\nficiency of blood supply to the brain, or by a blood clot\\nbriefly blocking a cerebral artery . It occurs suddenly ,\\nlasts a few minutes to a few hours, and is a strong warn-\\ning sign of an impending stroke. Ischemia can also affect\\nintestines, legs, feet, and kidneys. Pain, malfunctions,\\nand damage in those areas may result.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nIschemia almost always is caused by blockage of an\\nartery , usually due to atherosclerotic plaque. Myocardial\\nischemia also is caused by blood clots (which tend to\\nform on plaque), artery spasms or contractions, or any of\\nthese factors combined. Silent ischemia usually is caused\\nby emotional or mental stress or by exertion, but there are\\nno symptoms. Angina usually is caused by increased oxy-\\ngen demand when the heart is working harder than usual,\\nfor example, during exercise, or during mental or physical\\nstress. According to researchers at Harvard University ,\\nphysical stress is harder on the heart than mental stress.\\nRisk factors\\nThe risk factors for myocardial ischemia are the\\nsame as those for coronary artery disease, TIA, and\\nstroke:\\n• Heredity . People whose parents have coronary artery\\ndisease are more likely to develop it. African-Ameri-\\ncans also are at higher risk.\\n• Sex. Men are more likely to have heart attacks than\\nwomen, and to have them at a younger age. Angina is\\nmore likely to occur in women.\\n• Age. Men who are 45 years of age and older and\\nwomen who are 55 years of age and older are consid-\\nered to be at risk. Risk also increases with age.\\n• Smoking. Smoking increases both the chance of devel-\\noping coronary artery disease and the chance of dying\\nfrom it. Secondhand smoke also may increase risk.\\n• High cholesterol levels . Risk of developing coronary\\nartery disease increases as blood cholesterol levels in-\\ncrease. When combined with other factors, the risk is\\neven greater.\\n• High blood pressure. High blood pressure makes the\\nheart work harder, and with time, weakens it. When\\ncombined with obesity, smoking, high cholesterol lev-\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1107'),\n",

Fibrinogens are the proteins in-\\nvolved in blood clotting and plaque formation.\\n• High homeocysteine levels. Homeocysteine also is in-\\nvolved in plaque formation.\\n• Oxidant damage, as indicated by high lipid peroxide\\nlevels. High lipid peroxide levels represent a high level\\nof free radical damage and antioxidant deficiency .\\n• Lack of physical activity . Lack of exercise increases\\nthe risk of coronary artery disease.\\n• Diabetes mellitus. The risk of developing coronary\\nartery disease is seriously increased for diabetics.\\n• Obesity . Excess weight increases the strain on the heart\\nand increases the risk of developing coronary artery\\ndisease, even if no other risk factors are present. Obesi-\\nty increases blood pressure and blood cholesterol, and\\ncan lead to diabetes.\\n• Stress and anger. Some scientists believe that stress and\\nanger can contribute to the development of coronary\\nartery disease. Stress increases the heart rate and blood\\npressure and can injure the lining of the arteries. Angi-\\nna attacks often occur after outbursts of anger, as do\\nmany heart attacks and strokes.\\nAngina symptoms include:\\n• a tight, squeezing, heavy , burning, or choking pain that\\nis usually beneath the breastbone—the pain may spread\\nto the throat, jaw , or one arm\\n• a feeling of heaviness or tightness that is not painful\\n• a feeling similar to gas or indigestion\\n• attacks brought on by exertion and relieved by rest\\nIf the pain or discomfort continues or intensifies,\\nimmediate medical help should be sought, ideally within\\n30 minutes.\\nTIA symptoms include:\\n• sudden weakness, tingling, or numbness, usually in one\\narm or leg or both the arm and leg on the same side of\\nthe body , as well as sometimes in the face\\n• sudden loss of coordination\\n• loss of vision or double vision\\n• difficulty speaking\\n• vertigo and loss of balance\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnostic tests for myocardial ischemia include:\\nresting, exercise, or ambulatory electrocardiograms;\\nscintigraphic studies (radioactive heart scans); echocar-\\ndiography; coronary angiography; and, rarely , positron\\nemission tomography . Diagnostic tests for TIA include\\nphysician review of symptoms, computed tomography\\n(CT) scans, carotid artery ultrasound (Doppler ultra-\\nsonography), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\\nAngiography is the best test for ischemia of any organ.\\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart’s activi-\\nty and may reveal a lack of oxygen. Electrodes covered\\nwith conducting jelly are placed on the patient’s chest,\\narms, and legs. Impulses of the heart’s activity are record-\\ned on paper. The test takes about 10 minutes and is per-\\nformed in a physician’s office. About 25% of patients with\\nangina have normal electrocardiograms. Another type of\\nelectrocardiogram, the exercise stress test, measures re-\\nsponse to exertion when the patient is exercising on a\\ntreadmill or a stationary bike. It is performed in a physi-\\ncian’s office or an exercise laboratory and takes 15–30\\nminutes. This test is more accurate than a resting ECG in\\ndiagnosing ischemia. Sometimes an ambulatory ECG is\\nordered. For this test, the patient wears a portable ECG\\nmachine called a Holter monitor for 12, 24, or 48 hours.\\nMyocardial perfusion scintigraphy and radionuclide\\nangiography are nuclear studies involving the injection\\nof a radioactive material (e.g., thallium), that is absorbed\\nby healthy tissue. A gamma scintillation camera displays\\nand records a series of images of the radioactive materi-\\nal’s movement through the heart. Both tests usually are\\nperformed in a hospital’ s nuclear medicine department\\nand take about 30 minutes to an hour . A perfusion scan\\nsometimes is performed at the end of a stress test.\\nAn echocardiogram uses sound waves to create an\\nimage of the heart’s chambers and valves. The technolo-\\ngist applies gel to a handheld transducer, then presses it\\nagainst the patient’s chest. The heart’s sound waves are\\nconverted into an image on a monitor. Performed in a\\ncardiology outpatient diagnostic laboratory , the test takes\\n30 minutes to an hour. It can reveal abnormalities in the\\nheart wall that indicate ischemia, but it does not evaluate\\nthe coronary arteries directly .\\nCoronary angiography is the most accurate diagnostic\\ntechnique, but it also is the most invasive. It shows the\\nheart’s chambers, great vessels, and coronary arteries by\\nusing a contrast solution and x-ray technology . A moving\\npicture is recorded of the blood flow through the coronary\\narteries. The patient is awake, but sedated, and connected\\nto ECG electrodes and an intravenous line. A local anes-\\nthetic is injected. The cardiologist then inserts a catheter\\ninto a blood vessel and guides it into the heart.

Flaxseed oil is a good source of omega-3 oils.\\nNumerous studies have demonstrated the cardio-pro-\\ntective effects of omega-3 fatty acids.\\n• Considering supplements for specific health problems.\\nIndividuals with diabetes might benefit from chromium,\\ngarlic, and pantethine supplements. Niacin, flaxseed oil,\\nand garlic help treat elevated fibrinogen levels. For those\\nwith high homocysteine levels, vitamin B\\n6,B 12, and folic\\nacid may be needed. Patients with high lipid peroxide\\nlevels require more antioxidants to prevent free radical\\ndamage. Antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E,seleni-\\num, Ginkgo biloba, bilberry (V accinium myrtillus), and\\nhawthorn , can help prevent initial arterial injury that\\ncan lead to the formation of plaque deposits.

These\\npatients showed fewer cardiovascular events such as heart\\nattack and stroke, than those treated more conservatively .\\nAspirin helps prevent blood clots. Surgical procedures in-\\nclude percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty\\nand coronary artery bypass graft surgery .\\nNitroglycerin is the classic treatment for angina. It\\nquickly relieves pain and discomfort by opening the\\ncoronary arteries and allowing more blood to flow to the\\nheart. Beta-blockers reduce the amount of oxygen re-\\nquired by the heart during stress. Calcium channel\\nblockers help keep the arteries open and reduce blood\\npressure. Aspirin helps prevent blood clots from forming\\non plaques. Statins help reduce cholesterol levels, which\\ncan lessen ischemic events.\\nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and\\ncoronary artery bypass graft surgery are invasive proce-\\ndures that improve blood flow in the coronary arteries.\\nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is a\\nnonsurgical procedure in which a catheter tipped with a\\nballoon is threaded from a blood vessel in the thigh into\\nthe blocked artery . The balloon is inflated, compressing\\nthe plaque to enlarge the blood vessel and open the\\nblocked artery . The balloon is deflated and the catheter is\\nremoved. Sometimes a metal stent is placed in the artery\\nto prevent closing.\\nIn coronary artery bypass graft, called bypass surgery ,\\na detour is built around the coronary artery blockage with\\na healthy leg vein or chest wall artery . The healthy vein or\\nartery then supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart. By-\\npass surgery is major surgery appropriate for patients with\\nblockages in two or three major coronary arteries or se-\\nverely narrowed left main coronary arteries, as well as\\nthose who have not responded to other treatments.\\nThere are several experimental surgical procedures:\\natherectomy , in which the surgeon shaves off and re-\\nmoves strips of plaque from the blocked artery; laser an-\\ngioplasty , in which a catheter with a laser tip is inserted\\nto burn or break down the plaque; and insertion of a\\nmetal coil, called a stent, that can be implanted perma-\\nnently to keep a blocked artery open. This stenting pro-\\ncedure is becoming more common. An experimental pro-\\ncedure uses a laser to drill channels in the heart muscle\\nto increase blood supply .\\nTIAs are treated by drugs that control high blood\\npressure and reduce the likelihood of blood clots and\\nsurgery . Aspirin is commonly used and anticoagulants\\nare sometimes used to prevent blood clots. In some\\ncases, carotid endarterectomy surgery is performed to\\nhelp prevent further TIAs. The procedure involves re-\\nmoving arterial plaque from inside blood vessels.\\nExpected results\\nIn many cases, ischemia can be successfully treated,\\nbut the underlying disease process of atherosclerosis is\\nusually not “cured. ” New diagnostic techniques enable\\ndoctors to identify ischemia earlier. New technologies\\nand surgical procedures can prevent angina from leading\\nto a heart attack or TIA from resulting in a stroke. The\\noutcome for patients with silent ischemia has not been\\nwell established.\\nPrevention\\nA healthy lifestyle, including eating a well-balanced\\ndiet,getting regular exercise, maintaining a healthy\\nweight, not smoking, drinking in moderation, not using\\nillegal drugs, controlling hypertension , and managing\\nstress are practices that can reduce the risk of ischemia\\nprogressing to a heart attack or stroke.\\nA healthy diet includes a variety of foods that are\\nlow in fat (especially saturated fat), low in cholesterol,\\nand high in fiber. Plenty of fruits and vegetables should\\nbe eaten and sodium intake should be limited. Fat\\nshould comprise no more than 30% of total daily calo-\\nries. Cholesterol should be limited to about 300 mg and\\nsodium to about 2,400 mg per day .\\nModerate aerobic exercise lasting about 30 minutes\\nfour or more times per week is recommended for maxi-\\nmum heart health, according to the Centers for Disease\\nControl and Prevention and the American College of\\nSports Medicine. Three 10-minute exercise periods also\\nare beneficial. If any risk factors are present, a physician’s\\nclearance should be obtained before starting exercise.\\nMaintaining a desirable body weight also is impor-\\ntant. People who are 20% or more over their ideal body\\nweight have an increased risk of developing coronary\\nartery disease or stroke.\\nSmoking has many adverse effects on the heart and ar-\\nteries, and should be avoided. Heart damage caused by\\nsmoking can be improved by quitting. Several studies have\\nshown that ex-smokers face the same risk of heart disease\\nas nonsmokers within five to ten years after quitting.\\nExcessive drinking can increase risk factors for\\nheart disease. Modest consumption of alcohol, however,\\ncan actually protect against coronary artery disease. The\\nAmerican Heart Association defines moderate consump-\\ntion as one ounce of alcohol per day—roughly one cock-\\ntail, one 8-oz glass of wine, or two 12-oz glasses of beer.\\nCommonly used illegal drugs can seriously harm the\\nheart and should never be used. Even stimulants like\\nephedra and decongestants like pseudoephedrine can be\\nharmful to patients with hypertension or heart disease.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21110\\nIschemia\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1110'),\n",

The medical term for itching is\\npruritus.\\nDescription\\nItching leads most people instinctively to scratch the\\naffected area. Different people can tolerate different\\namounts of itching, and anyone’s threshold of tolerance\\ncan be changed due to stress , emotions, and other fac-\\ntors. In general, itching is more severe if the skin is\\nwarm, and if there are few distractions. This is why peo-\\nple tend to notice itching more at night.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAs of 2002, the recent discovery of itch-specific\\nneurons (nerve cells) has given doctors a better under-\\nstanding of the causes of the sensation of itching. Anoth-\\ner factor that contributes to itching is the release of en-\\ndogenous opioids in the body . While these chemicals\\nfunction primarily to relieve pain , they also appear to\\nenhance the sensation of itching. Although itching is the\\nTreatment should be sought for hypertension. High\\nblood pressure can be completely controlled through\\nlifestyle changes and medication. Stress, which can in-\\ncrease the risk of a heart attack or stroke, should also be\\nmanaged. While it cannot always be avoided, it can be\\ncontrolled.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAmerican Heart Association. Heart Attack Treatment, Preven-\\ntion, Recovery.

Jaundice is sometimes called icterus,f r o m\\na Greek word for “the condition. ”\\nDescription\\nIn order to understand jaundice, it is useful to know\\nabout the role of the liver in producing bile. The most im-\\nportant function of the liver is the metabolic processing of\\nchemical waste products like cholesterol , and excreting\\nthem into the intestines as bile. The liver is the premier\\nchemical factory in the body—most incoming and outgo-\\ning chemicals pass through it. It is the first stop for all nu-\\ntrients, toxins, and drugs absorbed by the digestive tract.\\nThe liver also collects chemicals from the blood for pro-\\ncessing. Many of these outward bound chemicals are ex-\\ncreted into the bile. One particular substance, bilirubin, is\\nyellow . Bilirubin is a product of the breakdown of hemo-\\nglobin, which is the protein inside red blood cells. If\\nbilirubin cannot leave the body , it accumulates and dis-\\ncolors other tissues. The normal total level of bilirubin in\\nblood serum is between 0.2 mg/dL and 1.2 mg/dL. When\\nit rises to 3 mg/dL or higher, the person’s skin and the\\nwhites of the eyes become noticeably yellow .\\nBile is formed in the liver. It then passes into the\\nnetwork of hepatic bile ducts, which join to form a single\\ntube. A branch of this tube carries bile to the gallbladder,\\nwhere it is stored, concentrated, and released on a signal\\nfrom the stomach. Food entering the stomach is the sig-\\nnal that stimulates the gallbladder to release the bile. The\\ntube, which is called the common bile duct, continues to\\nthe intestines. Before the common bile duct reaches the\\nintestines, it is joined by another duct from the pancreas.\\nThe bile and the pancreatic juice enter the intestine\\nthrough a valve called the ampulla of V ater. After enter-\\ning the intestine, the bile and pancreatic secretions to-\\ngether help in the process of digestion.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThere are many different causes for jaundice, but\\nthey can be divided into three categories based on where\\nthey start—before (pre-hepatic), in (hepatic), or after\\n(post-hepatic) the liver. When bilirubin begins its life\\ncycle, it cannot be dissolved in water. Thus, the liver\\nchanges it so that it is soluble in water. These two types\\nof bilirubin are called unconjugated (insoluble) and con-\\njugated (soluble). Blood tests can easily distinguish be-\\ntween these two types of bilirubin.\\nHemoglobin and bilirubin formation\\nBilirubin begins as hemoglobin in the blood-form-\\ning organs, primarily the bone marrow . If the production\\nof red blood cells (RBCs) falls below normal, the extra\\nhemoglobin finds its way into the bilirubin cycle and\\nadds to the pool.\\nOnce hemoglobin is in the red cells of the blood, it\\ncirculates for the life span of those cells. The hemoglo-\\nbin that is released when the cells die is turned into\\nbilirubin. If for any reason the RBCs die at a faster rate\\nthan usual, then bilirubin can accumulate in the blood\\nand cause jaundice.\\nHemolytic disorders\\nMany disorders speed up the death of red blood\\ncells. The process of red blood cell destruction is called\\nhemolysis, and the diseases that cause it are called he-\\nmolytic disorders. If red blood cells are destroyed faster\\nthan they can be produced, the patient develops anemia.\\nJ\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1115\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1115'),\n",

There are\\nmany genetic mutations that affect the hemoglobin it-\\nself, the best known of which is sickle cell disease.\\nSuch hereditary disorders as spherocytosis weaken the\\nouter membrane of the red cell. There are also inherited\\ndefects that involve the internal chemistry of RBCs.\\n• Enlargement of the spleen. The spleen is an organ that is\\nlocated near the upper end of the stomach and filters the\\nblood. It is supposed to filter out and destroy only worn-\\nout RBCs. If it has become enlarged, it filters out normal\\ncells as well. Malaria, other infections , cancers and\\nleukemias, some of the hereditary anemias mentioned\\nabove, obstruction of blood flow from the spleen—all\\nthese and many more diseases can enlarge the spleen to\\nthe point where it removes too many red blood cells.\\n• Diseases of the small blood vessels. Hemolysis that oc-\\ncurs in diseased small blood vessels is called microan-\\ngiopathic hemolysis. It results from damage caused by\\nrough surfaces on the inside of the capillaries. The\\nRBCs squeeze through capillaries one at a time and can\\neasily be damaged by scraping against the vessel walls.\\n• Immune reactions to RBCs. Several types of cancer\\nand immune system diseases produce antibodies that\\nreact with RBCs and destroy them. In 75% of cases,\\nthis reaction occurs all by itself, with no underlying\\ndisease to account for it.\\n• Transfusions. If a patient is given an incompatible\\nblood type, hemolysis results.\\n• Kidney failure and other serious diseases.

Erythroblastosis fetalis is a dis-\\nease of newborns marked by the presence of too many\\nimmature red blood cells (erythroblasts) in the baby’s\\nblood. When a baby’s mother has a different blood\\ntype, antibodies from the mother may leak into the\\nbaby’s circulation and destroy blood cells. This reac-\\ntion can produce severe hemolysis and jaundice in the\\nnewborn. Rh factor incompatibility is the most com-\\nmon cause.\\n• High bilirubin levels in newborns. Even in the absence\\nof blood type incompatibility , the newborn’s bilirubin\\nlevel may reach threatening levels.\\nNormal jaundice in newborns\\nNormal newborn jaundice is the result of two condi-\\ntions occurring at the same time—a prehepatic and a hepat-\\nic source of excess bilirubin. First of all, the baby at birth\\nimmediately begins converting hemoglobin from a fetal\\ntype to an adult type. The fetal type of hemoglobin was able\\nHemolysis can occur in a number of diseases, disorders,\\nconditions, and medical procedures:\\n• Malaria . The malaria parasite develops inside red\\nblood cells. When it is mature it breaks the cell apart\\nand swims off in the blood. This process happens to\\nmost of the parasites simultaneously , causing the inter-\\nmittent symptoms of the disease. When enough cells\\nburst at once, jaundice may result from the large\\namount of bilirubin formed from the hemoglobin in the\\ndead cells. The pigment may reach the urine in suffi-\\ncient quantities to cause “blackwater fever, ” an often\\nlethal form of malaria.\\n• Side effects of certain drugs. Some common drugs can\\ncause hemolysis as a rare but sudden side effect. These\\nmedications include some antibiotic and antituberculo-\\nsis medicines; drugs that regulate the heartbeat; and\\nlevodopa, a drug used to treat Parkinson’s disease.\\n• Certain drugs in combination with a hereditary enzyme\\ndeficiency known as glucose–6–phosphate dehydroge-\\nnase (G6PD). G6PD is a deficiency that affects more\\nthan 200 million people in the world. Some of the\\ndrugs listed above are more likely to cause hemolysis\\nin people with G6PD. Other drugs cause hemolysis\\nonly in people with this disorder. Most important\\namong these drugs are such antimalarial medications,\\nas quinine, and vitamins C and K.\\n• Poisons. Snake and spider venom, certain bacterial tox-\\nins, copper, and some organic industrial chemicals di-\\nrectly attack the membranes of red blood cells.\\n• Artificial heart valves. The inflexible moving parts of\\nheart valves damage RBCs as they flutter back and\\nforth. This damage is one reason to recommend pig\\nvalves and valves made of other organic materials.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1116'),\n",

At birth the infant can extract oxygen di-\\nrectly from his or her own lungs and does not need the fetal\\nhemoglobin any more. So fetal hemoglobin is removed\\nfrom the system and replaced with adult hemoglobin. The\\nresulting bilirubin loads the system and places demands on\\nthe liver to clear it. But the liver is not quite ready for the\\ntask, so there is a period of a week or so when the liver has\\nto catch up. During that time the baby is jaundiced.\\nIn 2002 new studies found that infants younger than\\neight weeks old with jaundice often had hidden (asymp-\\ntomatic) urinary tract infections. Previous studies have\\nshown that newborn jaundice may be an early sign of\\nbacterial infections in infants. The study recommended\\nthat pediatricians routinely test young infants with jaun-\\ndice for urinary tract infections.\\nHepatic jaundice\\nLiver diseases of all kinds threaten the organ’s abili-\\nty to keep up with bilirubin processing. Starvation, circu-\\nlating infections, certain medications, hepatitis, and cir-\\nrhosis can all cause hepatic jaundice, as can certain\\nhereditary defects of liver chemistry , including Gilbert’s\\nsyndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome.\\nPost-hepatic jaundice\\nPost-hepatic forms of jaundice include the jaundices\\ncaused by failure of soluble bilirubin to reach the in-\\ntestines after it has left the liver. These disorders are\\ncalled obstructive jaundices. The most common cause of\\nobstructive jaundice is the presence of gallstones in the\\nducts of the biliary system. Other causes have to do with\\nbirth defects and infections that damage the bile ducts;\\ndrugs; infections; cancers; and physical injury . Some\\ndrugs—and pregnancy on rare occasions—simply cause\\nthe bile in the ducts to stop flowing.\\nSymptoms and complications associated\\nwith jaundice\\nCertain chemicals in bile may cause itching when too\\nmuch of them end up in the skin. In newborns, insoluble\\nbilirubin may get into the brain and do permanent damage.\\nLong-standing jaundice may upset the balance of chemi-\\ncals in the bile and cause stones to form. Apart from these\\npotential complications and the discoloration of skin and\\neyes, jaundice by itself is inoffensive. Other symptoms are\\ndetermined by the disease producing the jaundice.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysical examination\\nIn many cases, the diagnosis of jaundice is suggest-\\ned by the appearance of the patient’s eyes and complex-\\nion. The doctor will ask the patient to lie flat on the ex-\\namining table in order to feel (palpate) the liver and\\nspleen for enlargement and to evaluate any abdominal\\npain . The location and severity of abdominal pain and\\nthe presence or absence of fever help the doctor to dis-\\ntinguish between hepatic and obstructive jaundice.\\nLaboratory tests\\nDisorders of blood formation can be diagnosed by\\nmore thorough examination of the blood or the bone\\nmarrow , where blood is made. Occasionally a bone mar-\\nrow biopsy is required, but usually the blood itself will\\nreveal the diagnosis. The spleen can be evaluated by an\\nultrasound examination or a nuclear scan if the physical\\nexamination has not yielded enough information.\\nImaging studies\\nDisease in the biliary system can be identified by\\nimaging techniques, of which there are many . X rays are\\ntaken a day after swallowing a contrast agent that is se-\\ncreted into the bile. This study gives functional as well as\\nanatomical information. There are several ways of inject-\\ning x-ray dye directly into the bile ducts. It can be done\\nthrough a thin needle pushed straight into the liver, or\\nthrough a scope passed through the stomach that can in-\\nject dye into the ampulla of V ater. CT and MRI scans are\\nvery useful for imaging certain conditions, such as can-\\ncers in and around the liver, or gallstones in the common\\nbile duct.\\nLiver disease is usually assessed from blood studies\\nalone, but again a biopsy may be necessary to clarify less\\nobvious conditions. A liver biopsy is performed at the\\nbedside. The doctor uses a thin needle to take a tiny core\\nof tissue from the liver. The tissue sample is sent to the\\nlaboratory for examination under a microscope.\\nAssessment of jaundice in newborns\\nNewborns are more likely to have problems with\\njaundice if:\\n• They are premature.\\n• They are of Asian or Native American descent.\\n• They have been bruised during the birth process.\\n• They have lost too much weight during the first few\\ndays.\\n• They are born at a high altitude.\\n• The mother has diabetes.\\n• Labor had to be induced.\\nIn 2003, research was continuing to find noninvasive\\nmethods to determine bilirubin levels in newborns so\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1117\\nJaundice\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1117'),\n",

If the original passageways cannot be restored, sur-\\ngeons have several ways to create alternate routes. T o\\ncreate alternate passageways, a surgeon will sew an open\\npiece of intestine over a bare patch of liver. Tiny bile\\nducts in that part of the liver will begin to discharge their\\nbile into the intestine, and pressure from the obstructed\\nducts elsewhere will find release in that direction. As the\\nflow increases, the ducts grow to accommodate it. Soon,\\nall the bile is redirected through the open pathways.\\nPrevention\\nErythroblastosis fetalis can be prevented by giving\\nan Rh-negative mother a gamma globulin solution called\\nRhoGAM whenever there is a possibility that she is de-\\nveloping antibodies to her baby’s blood.

It is commonplace: a 2002 study of inter-\\nnational business travelers (IBTs) found that jet lag was\\none of the most common health problems reported, af-\\nfecting as many as 74% of IBTs.\\nDescription\\nLiving organisms are accustomed to periods of night\\nand day alternating at set intervals. Most of the human\\nbody’s regulating hormones follow this cycle, known as cir-\\ncadian rhythm. The word circadian comes from the Latin,\\ncirca, meaning about, and dies, meaning day . These cycles\\nare not exactly 24 hours long, hence the “circa. ” Each chem-\\nical has its own cycle of highs and lows, interacting with and\\ninfluencing the other cycles. Body temperature, sleepiness,\\nthyroid function, growth hormone, metabolic processes,\\nadrenal hormones, and the sleep hormone melatonin all\\ncycle with daylight. There is a direct connection between the\\nretina (the light-sensitive structure at the back of the eye) and\\nthe part of the brain that controls all these hormones. Artifi-\\ncial light has some effect but sunlight has much more. Dis-\\nruption of circadian rhythms affects the sleep-wake cycles of\\nnight-shift workers as well as travelers.\\nWhen people are without clocks in a compartment\\nthat is completely closed to sunlight, most of them fall\\ninto a circadian cycle of about 25 hours. Normally , all\\nthe regulating chemicals follow one another in order like\\nthreads in a weaving pattern. Every morning the sunlight\\nresets the cycle, stimulating the leading chemicals and\\nthus compensating for the difference between the 24-\\nhour day and the 25-hour innate rhythm.\\nWhen traveling through a number of time zones, most\\npeople reset their rhythms within a few days, demonstrating\\nthe adaptability of the human species. Some people, howev-\\ner, have upset circadian rhythms that last indefinitely .\\nCauses & symptoms\\nTraveling through a few time zones at a time is not\\nas disruptive to circadian rhythms as traveling around the\\nworld can be. The foremost symptom of jet lag is altered\\nsleep pattern—sleepiness during the day , and insomnia\\nduring the night. Jet lag may also include indigestion\\nand trouble concentrating. Individuals afflicted by jet lag\\nwill alternate in and out of a normal day-night cycle.\\nT reatment\\nExposure to bright morning sunlight cures jet lag\\nafter a few days in most people.

For these, there is a curi-\\nous treatment that has achieved success. By forcing\\none’s self into a 27 hour day , complete with the appropri-\\nate stimulation from bright light, all the errant chemical\\ncycles will be able to catch up during one week.\\nWhen selecting an international flight, individuals\\nshould try to arrange an early evening arrival in their desti-\\nnation city . When an individual is traveling to a destina-\\ntion in the east, he or she can try going to bed and waking\\nup a few hours earlier several days before their flight. If\\ntravel is to the west, going to bed and waking up later than\\nusual can help the body start to adjust to the upcoming\\ntime change. More specific recommendations are avail-\\nable as of 2002, tailored to whether the person is traveling\\nthrough six time zones, 7–9 zones, or 10 or more.\\nThe following precautions taken during an interna-\\ntional flight can help to limit or prevent jet lag:\\n• Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water and juices to pre-\\nvent dehydration. Beverages and foods with caffeine\\nshould be avoided because of their stimulant properties.\\nAlcohol should also be avoided.\\n• Stretch and walk. As much movement as possible dur-\\ning a flight helps circulation, which moves nutrients\\nand waste through the body and aids in elimination.\\n• Stay on time. Set watches and clocks ahead to the time\\nin the destination city to start adjusting to the change.\\n• Sleep smart. Draw the shade and sleep during the\\nevening hours in the destination city , even if it is still\\ndaylight outside of the airplane. Earplugs and sleep\\nmasks may be helpful in blocking noise and light.\\nMany airlines provide these items on international\\nflights.\\n• Dress comfortably . W ear or bring comfortable clothes\\nand slippers that will make sleeping during the flight\\neasier.\\nOnce arriving in their destination city , individuals\\nshould spend as much time outdoors in the sunlight as\\npossible during the day to reset their internal clock and\\nlessen the symptoms of jet lag. Bedtime should be post-\\nponed until at least 10 \\nP.M., with no daytime naps. If a\\ndaytime nap is absolutely necessary , it should be limited\\nto no more than two hours.\\nT o promote a restful sleeping environment in a hotel\\nsetting, travelers should request that the hotel desk hold\\nall phone calls. Because sleeping in too late can also pro-\\nlong jet lag, an early wake up call should be requested if\\nan alarm clock is not available. If the hotel room is noisy ,\\na portable white noise machine can help to block outside\\ntraffic and hallway noises. A room air conditioner or fan\\ncan serve the same purpose. The temperature in the room\\nshould also be adjusted for sleeping comfort.\\nNew information shows that exercise when at the\\ndestination can also help. When headed westbound, trav-\\nelers should exercise for one hour in the evening. If\\ngoing eastbound, they do best by exercising in the morn-\\ning.\\nAll antioxidants help to decrease the effects of jet\\nlag. Extra doses of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as zinc\\nand selenium , two days before and two days after a\\nflight help to alleviate jet lag. Melatonin, a hormone that\\nhelps to regulate circadian rhythms, can also help to\\ncombat jet lag. Melatonin is available as an over-the-\\ncounter supplement in most health food stores and phar-\\nmacies. Reports in 2002 show that the drug is safe for\\nshort-term use and recommend 5 mg between 10 pm and\\nmidnight at the destination to help fall asleep and to\\nsleep better.\\nIf weather prevents an individual from spending time\\nin the sunlight, light therapy may be beneficial in de-\\ncreasing jet lag symptoms. Light therapy , or photothera-\\npy , uses a device called a light box, which contains a set\\nof fluorescent or incandescent lights in front of a reflec-\\ntor. T ypically , the patient sits for 30 minutes next to a\\n10,000-lux box (which is about 50 times as bright as an\\nordinary indoor light). Light therapy is safe for most peo-\\nple, but those with eye diseases should consult a health-\\ncare professional before undergoing the treatment.\\nIn 2002, a team from Flanders University invented\\nnew jet lag sunglasses equipped with a vision device that\\nused light to stimulate travelers’ brains. They believed\\nthat wearing the glasses before and during flights could\\nhelp the internal human clock adjust more easily to\\nchanging time zones. The researchers were looking for a\\ncommercial partner to help them further study the glass-\\nes and make them widely available. The effectiveness of\\nglasses or other head-mounted light devices is still un-\\ncertain, however. A team of researchers at Columbia\\nUniversity reported in the fall of 2002 that the use of a\\nhead-mounted light visor yielded only modest improve-\\nment in the test subjects’ symptoms of jet lag.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nIn cases of short-term insomnia triggered by jet lag,\\na physician may recommend sleeping pills or prescrip-\\ntion medication. Such medication should be taken only\\nunder the guidance of a health care professional.\\nA newer medication that is considered investigation-\\nal is a melatonin agonist presently known as L Y 156735.\\nAn agonist is a drug that stimulates activity at cell recep-\\ntors that are normally stimulated by such naturally oc-\\ncurring substances as melatonin. L Y 156735 was found\\nto speed up the readaptation time of volunteer subjects\\nfollowing a simulated 9-hour time shift.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1121\\nJet lag\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1121'),\n",

A fungal infection of\\nthe skin on the arms, legs or chest is called Tinea cor-\\nporis. Athlete’s foot or Tinea pedis is a fungal infection\\nin the moist skin fold between the toes. Fungal infection\\naffecting the toenails is called Tinea unguium, and caus-\\nes thickened, crumbly toenails.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe mode of transmission of fungal infections is not\\nclear, but it seems that some individuals are more prone\\nto development of the infection than others. An average\\nof one in five people develops fungal infection at some\\npoint during their lifetime. Fungal infection can also be\\ncarried by household pets, such as cats and dogs, or by\\nfarm animals. In animals, fungal infection manifests it-\\nself as a missing area of fur. In humans, as the fungus\\ngrows, it spreads to surrounding tissues in a circular\\nfashion, with the skin in the middle returning to a normal\\nappearance. The borders of the affected area may look\\nred and scaly , and the individual may complain of in-\\ntense itching and/or burning. Because the borders devel-\\nop a raised appearance, there may appear to be a worm\\nbeneath the skin and be referred to as ringworm. There\\nis, however, no worm affecting the skin or underlying\\ntissue in cases of fungal infections, including jock itch.\\nDiagnosis\\nOften a case of jock itch can be identified based on\\nthe characteristic description previously described. If as-\\nsessed by a conventional doctor, the area of affected skin\\nmay be scraped onto a glass slide for definitive diagnosis\\nunder the microscope. In order to determine the exact\\ntype of fungus present, a small piece of affected skin\\nmay be sent to a laboratory for further study or cultured\\nvia scrapings from the affected area.\\nT reatment\\nT opical treatments include poultices of peppermint,\\noregano, or lavender. T ea tree oildiluted with a carrier\\noil of almond oil can be applied to the rash several times\\nper day . Cedarwood and jasmine oils can relieve itching\\nwhen applied in the same manner. Grapefruit seed ex-\\ntract can be taken as a strong solution of 15 drops in 1\\noz of water.\\nBupleurum, or Chinese thoroughwax , is an Asian\\nplant that has been used in traditional Chinese medi-\\ncine and Japanese Kampo formulations to treat jock itch\\nand other fungal skin infections. Bupleurum contains\\ncompounds known as saikosaponins, which have anti-al-\\nlergic and anti-inflammatory effects.\\nA good remedy for jock itch is to wash the groin\\narea with the diluted juice of a freshly squeezed lemon,\\nwhich can help dry up the rash. A hair dryer on the cool\\nsetting can also be used on the area after showering to\\ndry it thoroughly . A warm bath relieves itching in many\\npatients. The affected area should kept clean and dry , and\\npatients are advised to wear loose-fitting pure cotton un-\\nderwear. Fabrics that contain polyester or nylon hold\\nmoisture against the body .\\nAllopathic treatment\\nT ypical conventional treatment for jock itch involves\\nthe use of an antifungal cream, spray , or powder twice a\\nday for about two weeks. T wo commonly used over-the-\\ncounter antifungal preparations are clotrimazole\\n(Lotrimin) and tolnaftate (Tinactin). While the tendency\\nto discontinue treatment once itching disappears is com-\\nmon, patients should use the antifungal preparation for a\\nfull two-week course in order to prevent recurrence of\\nthe infection. As of 2002, doctors recommend continuing\\nthe treatment for a full week following clinical clearance\\nof the infection.\\nExpected results\\nMost tinea infections resolve without scarring or\\nspread of infection below the skin’s surface. Inflamma-\\ntion, however, may require the use of a combination anti-\\nfungal/steroid medication.\\nPrevention\\nCareful attention to skin hygiene, including the\\nmaintenance of clean, dry , and intact skin, is the most\\nimportant step in preventing the development of fungal\\ninfection. Light clothing should be worn during warm\\nweather to decrease perspiration and allow dissipation of\\nbody heat. Clean and dry cotton underwear will wick\\nperspiration away from the skin, and prevent jock itch\\nfrom developing. Use baby powder to keep the area dry\\nduring exercise. Do not share towels at the gym. Dietary\\nmeasures discussed under treatment will also prevent ini-\\ntial fungal infection and/or recurrence.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGottlieb, Bill.

Frey , PhD\\nJojoba oil\\nDescription\\nJojoba (pronounced ho-ho-ba) oil is a vegetable oil\\nobtained from the crushed bean of the jojoba shrub (Sim-\\nmondsia chinenis). The jojoba shrub is native to the Sono-\\nran Desert of northwestern Mexico and neighboring re-\\ngions in Arizona and southern California. It grows in dense\\nstands throughout that region. The woody evergreen shrub\\nmay reach 15 ft (4.5 m) in height. Jojoba has flat gray-\\ngreen leathery leaves and a deep root system that make it\\nwell adapted to desert heat and drought. It has a life span of\\n100–200 years, depending on environmental conditions.\\nJojoba grows best in areas with 10–18 in (25–45 cm) of an-\\nnual rainfall where temperatures seldom fall below 25°F (-\\n4°C) for more than a few hours at night. It can grow on\\nmany types of soils, including porous rocks, in slightly\\nacid to alkaline soils, and on mountain slopes or in valleys.\\nJojoba shrubs are dioecious, meaning plants are ei-\\nther male (staminate), producing pollen, or female (pis-\\ntillate), producing flowers. The small flowers have no\\nodor or petals and do not attract pollinating insects. The\\nflowers are pollinated by wind in late March; the flowers\\ndevelop into fruit by August, with full maturation occur-\\nring by October. The green fruit dries in the desert heat,\\nits outer skin shriveling and pulling back to expose a\\nwrinkled brown soft-skinned seed (referred to as a nut or\\nbean) the size of a small olive. These nuts, which resem-\\nble coffee beans, contain a vegetable oil that is clear and\\nodorless but less oily to the touch than traditional edible\\noils. The oil comprises half of the weight of the nut.\\nThere are about 1,700 seeds in a pound; 17 lb (6.3 kg) of\\njojoba seeds are required to produce one gallon of oil.\\nNative Americans have used jojoba for hundreds of\\nyears. In the 1700s, Father Junipero Serra, the founder of\\n21 California missions, noted in his diary that the Native\\nAmericans were using the oil and the seeds for many dif-\\nferent purposes: for treating sores, cuts, bruises , and\\nburns; as a diet supplement and as an appetite suppres-\\nsant when food was not available; as a skin conditioner,\\nfor soothing windburn and sunburn; as a cooking oil; as\\na hair or scalp treatment and hair restorative; and as a\\ncoffee-like beverage by roasting the seeds.\\nThe chemical structure of jojoba oil is different from\\nthat of other vegetable oils. Rather than being an oil, it is\\nactually is a polyunsaturated liquid wax that is similar to\\nsperm whale oil, though without the fishy odor. It is made\\nof fatty acids as well as esters composed entirely of straight\\nchain alcohols. Both the acid and alcohol portions of jojo-\\nba oil have 20 or 22 carbon atoms, and each has one unsat-\\nurated bond. W axes of this type are difficult to synthesize.\\nAs a wax, jojoba oil is especially useful for applications\\nthat require moisture control, protection, and emolliency .\\nJojoba oil is liquid at room temperature because of its un-\\nsaturated fatty acids. It does not oxidize or become rancid\\nand does not break down under high temperatures and\\npressures. Jojoba oil can be heated to 370°F (188°C) for 96\\nhours without exhibiting degradation in general composi-\\ntion and carbon chain length. The stability shown by jojoba\\noil makes it especially useful for cosmetic applications.\\nWhen the United States banned the use of sperm whale\\noil (spermaceti wax) in 1974, the government began to fund\\nefforts to investigate and cultivate jojoba as a replacement.\\nJojoba oil was found to be an adequate substitute for appli-\\ncations that had previously used sperm whale oil. The first\\ncommercial cultivation of jojoba was in the Negev Desert\\nand Dead Sea areas of Israel, but by 1977, domestic cultiva-\\ntion had begun in the United States. In 2000, the Interna-\\ntional Jojoba Export Council expected the global jojoba\\nproduction to increase 15% over a five-year period.\\nGeneral use\\nJojoba oil has many uses in a wide variety of indus-\\ntries. As a cosmetic, it is an effective cleanser, condition-\\ner, moisturizer, and softener for the skin and hair.

Jojoba oil is simi-\\nlar to, and miscible with, sebum, which is secreted by\\nhuman sebaceous glands to lubricate and protect skin and\\nhair. When sebum production decreases due to age, pollu-\\ntants, or environmental stresses, jojoba oil can be used to\\nreplicate sebum oil. Jojoba oil can accumulate around\\nhair roots, thereby conditioning hair and preventing it\\nfrom becoming brittle and dull. If there is too much\\nsebum buildup on the scalp, it dissolves and removes the\\nsebum, leaving the hair clean. Jojoba oil as a solubilizing\\nagent can also remove sticky buildup on hair from hair\\npreparations as well as airborne particulates deposited on\\nthe hair.

It is\\noften used as an adjunct to many psychotherapy and re-\\ncovery programs. Healthcare practitioners maintain that\\nwritten expression fills a very important role in the thera-\\npeutic process by providing a mechanism of emotional\\nexpression in circumstances in which interpersonal ex-\\npression is not possible or viable.\\nOrigins\\nPeople have kept journals and diaries to record\\ndreams, memories, and thoughts since ancient times.\\nEmotional expression has also long held a central role in\\nthe study and practice of psychology . Throughout histo-\\nry , psychologists have advocated the expression of emo-\\ntions as essential for good mental and physical health.\\nSince the early 1980s, interest in this topic has resulted\\nin numerous research studies investigating the health\\nbenefits of expressive writing.\\nBenefits\\nJournal writing produces a number of benefits in\\nhealthy people—among other things, it enhances creativ-\\nity , helps cope with stress, and provides a written record\\nof memorable life experiences. Likewise, some re-\\nsearchers have found that journal writing has a number\\nof psychological and physical health benefits for people\\nwho are ill.\\nAside from a reduction in physical symptoms of dis-\\nease, the psychological benefits include reconciling\\nemotional conflicts, fostering self-awareness, managing\\nbehavior, solving problems, reducing anxiety, aiding re-\\nality orientation, and increasing self-esteem. Writing\\ntherapy has been used as an effective treatment for the\\ndevelopmentally , medically , educationally , socially , or\\npsychologically impaired and is practiced in mental\\nhealth, rehabilitation, medical, educational, and forensic\\ninstitutions. Populations of all ages, races, and ethnic\\nbackgrounds are served by writing therapy in individual,\\ncouple, family , and group therapy formats.\\nThe therapeutic use of expressive writing allows in-\\ndividuals to confront upsetting topics, thus alleviating\\nthe constraints or inhibitions associated with not talking\\nabout the event. The psychological drain of the inhibi-\\ntion is believed to cause and/or exacerbate stress-related\\ndisease processes. Researchers have found that emotion-\\nal expression facilitates cognitive processing of the trau-\\nmatic memory , which leads to emotional and physiologi-\\ncal change. Specifically , written emotional expression\\npromotes integration and understanding of the event\\nwhile reducing negative emotions associated with it.\\nDescription\\nJournal writing and other forms of writing therapy\\nare based on the premise that the mind and the body are\\ninseparably joined in the healing process. Although there\\nare many methods of conducting journal writing therapy\\ndepending on the therapeutic technique of the psycholo-\\ngist or psychiatrist, the therapist often instructs the par-\\nticipant to write about a distressing or traumatic event or\\nthought in one or more sessions.\\nAlthough researchers are uncertain about exactly\\nhow writing about traumas produces improvements in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21126\\nJournal therapy\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nNoncomedogenic —A substance that contains\\nnothing that would cause blackheads or pimples\\nto form on the skin.

Traumatic memories\\nare more emotional and perceptual in nature. The memo-\\nry is stored as a sensory perception, obsessional thought,\\nor behavioral reenactment. It is associated with persistent,\\nintrusive, and distressing symptoms, avoidance, and in-\\ntense anxiety that results in observed psychological and\\nbiological dysfunction. Thus, one goal in treating trau-\\nmatic memories is to find a means of processing them.\\nA narrative that becomes more focused and coherent\\nover a number of writing sessions is often associated\\nwith increased improvement, according to several re-\\nsearch studies. The memories become deconditioned and\\nrestructured into a personal, integrated narrative.\\nChanges in psychological well-being after writing thera-\\npy may result from cogniti ve shifts about the trauma ei-\\nther during or after the writing process.\\nPreparations\\nIn a health care setting, the participant often pre-\\npares for journal writing by receiving (from the thera-\\npist) a set of instructions regarding the length and focus\\nof the writing session or sessions. Other instructions may\\ninclude writing in a stream-of-consciousness fashion,\\nwithout censorship or concern about grammar or style.\\nPrecautions\\nIt is advisable that journal therapy be conducted only\\nby a licensed health professional, such as a certified art\\ntherapy practitioner or trained psychologist or psychiatrist.\\nWhile journal writing classes available to the general public\\nmay perform a variety of useful functions, these classes are\\nnot intended to provide medical therapy . In journal therapy ,\\nthe participant may , for example, uncover potentially trau-\\nmatic, repressed, or painful memories. Therefore, a trained\\nhealth professional may be necessary to supervise the\\nprocess and treat these symptoms as they arise.\\nSide effects\\nThere are no known side effects of journal or writ-\\ning therapy .\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nTherapeutic writing became an increasingly popular\\ntopic in the final decades of the twentieth century , not\\nonly among trained health care professionals, but also\\namong self-improvement speakers without medical\\ntraining. Seminars, workshops, and Internet sites pur-\\nportedly offering therapy though expressive writing\\nsprang up around the nation and gained popular accep-\\ntance. Despite the large body of research indicating that\\nwriting confers benefits on healthy people, the topic of\\nwriting therapy’s affects on diseased individuals has not\\nreceived a great deal of research attention. Although in-\\ncreasingly used by health care professionals as an ad-\\njunct to various therapeutic approaches, the practice has\\nbeen criticized by some members of the health care com-\\nmunity . Some researchers are distrustful of the findings\\nthat so much measurable improvement in health status\\ncan occur in just a few brief writing sessions.\\nIn the United Kingdom, the focus of journal therapy\\nhas been on descriptive accounts and psychodynamic ex-\\nplanations for subjective improvements in the health status\\nof participants. In the United States, on the other hand, the\\nfocus is on formal scientific research aimed at validating\\nthe impact of brief, highly standardized writing exercises\\non physical measures of illness. The research demon-\\nstrates that although physical measures of illness may\\nchange, the reasons for the change are not always clear.\\nIn the United States, one study on the effects of\\nwriting about stressful experiences on symptom reduc-\\ntion in patients with asthma or rheumatoid arthritis\\nfound that after four months of writing therapy—in con-\\njunction with standard pharmacotherapy—nearly half\\nthe patients enrolled in the study experienced clinically\\nrelevant improvement. A growing number of studies\\nhave documented symptom improvement in patients\\nwith psychiatric disorders as well, suggesting that ad-\\ndressing patients’ psychological needs produces both\\npsychological and physical health benefits.\\nT raining & certification\\nAlthough journal therapy is often provided by certi-\\nfied instructors who receive variable amounts of training\\nin a number of programs around the country , journal\\ntherapy is best administered by a licensed psychologist\\n(who may also be an art therapist) or psychiatrist.\\nEducational, professional, and ethical standards for\\nart therapists who conduct writing therapy are regulated\\nby the American Art Therapy Association, Inc.

A person may drink juice pre-\\nventively to stay healthy , to treat a medical condition like\\ncancer , or to produce a certain outcome, such as\\nstrengthening the immune system. Three widely prac-\\nticed juice therapies differ primarily in the amount of\\ntime that a person is involved in the therapy and whether\\nother items are included in the person’s diet.\\nFor some people, adding fresh juice to their daily\\nmeal plan is sufficient. Others will embark on a juice fast\\nfor several days to cleanse their systems. Juice is also a\\nmajor component of the so-called Gerson therapy diet\\nthat is used to treat cancer. This therapy usually starts\\nwith a stay of three to eight weeks in a clinic. Then ther-\\napy continues at home and may continue for years.\\nOrigins\\nFasting and juice consumption\\nThe two components of most juice therapies, fast-\\ning and juice consumption, date back thousands of years.\\nFasting is a long-standing religious tradition described in\\nthe Bible and other sources. The medicinal use of juice\\ncan be traced back thousands of years to India. Propo-\\nnents of A yurveda, a healing system, believed that drink-\\ning juice strengthens body tissues.\\nIn the centuries that followed, people recognized\\nthat eating fruit and vegetables produce many health\\nbenefits. Carrots were said to improve eyesight; and ac-\\ncording to the adage, “ An apple a day keeps the doctor\\naway . ” During the twentieth century , fruit and vegetables\\nbecame important components of healing therapy .\\nGerson juice diet\\nDuring the 1940s, a German doctor named Max B.\\nGerson developed a therapy using juice to treat his mi-\\ngraine. His diet was based on the theory that excessive\\nsodium in a person’s system disrupts the immune system\\nand the functions of the liver, pancreas, and thyroid\\ngland. Gerson developed a low-salt organic diet that fo-\\ncuses on raw vegetable and fruit juices. The diet includ-\\ned nutritional supplements and coffee enemas to detoxify\\nthe liver and relieve pain. The therapy worked for Ger-\\nson, so he recommended it to patients. People diagnosed\\nwith cancer and tuberculosis said that the Gerson diet\\ntherapy produced positive results.\\nAdvocates of juice therapies maintain that refraining\\nfrom food boosts the body’s ability to heal itself. Since\\nthe body is not spending time and energy on digesting\\nhigh-fat food, it can concentrate on healing instead. That\\nreasoning is the basis of juice fasts.\\nJuicing\\nAnother form of juice therapy known as juicing in-\\nvolves extracting the juice from raw fruit and vegetables.\\nFrom the 1970s on, people like “Juiceman” Jay Kordich\\npopularized the concept of drinking fresh juice to boost\\nenergy , lose weight, and achieve other health benefits.\\nKordich provided recipes and sold juice extractors that\\nare also known as “juicers. ”\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21128\\nJuice therapies\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nArt therapy —The use of art media to assess and\\ntreat an individual’ s development, abilities, per-\\nsonality , interests, concerns, or conflicts.\\nPsychodynamic research —The scientific study of\\nmental or conditional forces developing especial-\\nly in early childhood and their effect on behavior\\nand mental states.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1128'),\n",

One beverage consisted of juiced\\npotato, apple, carrot, and parsley.\\nBenefits\\nResearch has shown that a diet rich in fruit and veg-\\netables reduces the risk of such diseases such as heart dis-\\nease, cancer, and diabetes. Furthermore, raw vegetables\\nand fruit contain vitamins, food enzymes, minerals,\\namino acids , and natural sugars. Some of those benefits\\nmay be lost when commercial juice is purchased because\\njuice sold in stores is pasteurized, which results in the loss\\nof some nutrients. Fresh juice’s benefits extend beyond its\\nnutritional content, according to juice therapy advocates.\\nProponents of juice therapies continue to study its\\nbenefits. In 2002, a physician reported to the American\\nCollege of Cardiology that two cups of orange juice daily\\nsignificantly lowered the blood pressure of hypertensive\\npatients. A British study in the same year verified the posi-\\ntive effects of cranberry juice on urinary tract infections.\\nJuice is used in A yurvedic treatment for such condi-\\ntions as arthritis, anemia, and constipation. Juice is also\\na component of naturopathy , which is also known as the\\n“whole body cure. ” A naturopathic doctor may prescribe\\na juice fast.\\nSupporters of fasting believe that the process releas-\\nes a hormone that helps the body fight disease. A juice\\nfast will strengthen the immune system, according to ad-\\nherents. It may be part of naturopathic treatment for con-\\nditions including arthritis, cancer, and AIDS . The fast\\nalso allows the naturopathic physician to identify food\\nsensitivities (allergens) as the patient begins eating food.\\nJuice therapy is part of the Gerson diet, a cancer\\ntherapy said to eliminate the buildup of toxins in the\\nbody by stimulating enzymes, improving the digestive\\nsystem, and providing the correct balance of vitamins\\nand minerals.\\nDescription\\nJuice therapy can be as simple as extracting the juice\\nfrom raw produce or as complicated as the Gerson diet.\\nThe therapies vary in the amount of commitment in-\\nvolved and the cost. Whether a therapy is covered by\\nmedical insurance will depend on the patient’s health\\nplan. The person who juices or fasts at home generally\\nisn’t covered. A juice fast administered as part of another\\ntreatment by a doctor or health practitioner might be cov-\\nered. For Gerson therapy , some companies pay for part or\\nall of costs, according to the Gerson Institute website.\\nGerson therapy\\nThe Gerson therapy treatment is based on drinking\\nfreshly pressed vegetable and fruit juice every hour. Dur-\\ning a typical day at a Gerson clinic, a person would drink\\n13 glasses of raw carrot/apple and green-leaf vegetable\\njuices. V egetarian meals of organically grown food are\\nserved. During treatment, the patient receives caffeine\\nenemas during the evening to detoxify the blood and tis-\\nsues, according to the Gerson Institute website.\\nThe institute does not operate facilities; instead it li-\\ncenses such facilities as the Oasis of Hope Hospital in Ti-\\njuana, Mexico. The hospital opened a Gerson Therapy\\nCenter in September of 1999 that cost each patient $4,900\\nfor a week of care. That figure included the cost of a com-\\npanion’s housing as well as follow-up consultations.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1129\\nJuice therapies\\nType of Juice Vitamins and minerals\\nApple Chromium, selenium\\nAsparagus Vitamin E\\nBok choy Calcium\\nBroccoli Folic acid, vitamin K\\nBrussel sprouts Manganese\\nCabbage Chromium, manganese, vitamin C\\nCantaloupe Beta-carotene, potassium\\nCarrots Beta-carotene, zinc\\nCelery Potassium\\nCitrus fruits Vitamin C\\nCollard greens Calcium, vitamin K\\nGarlic Selenium\\nGinger Zinc\\nGreen peas Zinc\\nKale Calcium, folic acid, vitamin B 6 ,\\nvitamin K\\nOrange Folic acid\\nP apaya Beta-carotene\\nPeppers Vitamin C\\nSpinach Vitamin B 6, vitamin E\\nSweet peppers Chromium\\nT omatoes Potassium\\nT urnips Selenium\\nT urnip greens Manganese, vitamin B\\n6\\nVITAMINS AND MINERALS FOUND IN JUICES\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1129'),\n",

The fast could also be part of the program at a\\nretreat center.\\nAnother option is a short-term cleansing diet last-\\ning two to three days. One popular fast involves con-\\nsumption of fruit and vegetable juice for several days.\\nIn some plans, herbal tea and broth are allowed. Anoth-\\ner variation is the raw food diet, which involves eating\\nuncooked fruit and vegetables. The diet is said to be\\nuseful in treating such conditions as heart disease and\\narthritis.\\nJuicing\\nJuicing involves the extraction of juice from raw\\nfruit or vegetables. An extractor, fresh produce, and a\\ncommitment of time to juice the items are required. A\\nblender isn’t strong enough to juice raw produce, and ex-\\ntractors are priced from about $120–2,000. Juice should\\nbe consumed as soon as possible after extraction because\\nwhen it’s stored, juice loses its nutritional value.\\nBENEFICIAL JUICES. While most people know that\\norange juice is rich in vitamin C, the juice of other pro-\\nduce is believed to provide additional health benefits.\\nThe wide selection of juices offers benefits that include\\nthe following:\\n• An 8-oz (240 ml) glass of carrot juice contains more\\nthan 10 times the recommended daily allowance of vit-\\namin C.\\n• Fresh fruit and vegetable juices, including wheatgrass\\njuice, are consumed for ulcers. Ulcer remedies include\\nraw potato juice for peptic ulcers. For a duodenal ulcer,\\nraw cabbage juice can be mixed with carrot and celery\\njuice.\\n• Cranberries help prevent and treat urinary infections.\\n• Beet juice can be diluted to stimulate the liver.\\n• Garlic lowers the blood pressure and cholesterol.\\n• Cantaloupe juice can be consumed for stress.\\nPreparations\\nPeople should consult a doctor, practitioner, or nu-\\ntritionist before beginning a fast or treatment like Gerson\\ntherapy . The medical professional can determine whether\\nit’s safe to fast and how long the fast should last. The\\ndoctor may discover during the test that the person has a\\ncondition like diabetes. If that is the case, only a super-\\nvised fast would be recommended.\\nPrecautions\\nSome caution should be taken with each form of\\njuice therapy . Juicing removes much of the necessary di-\\netary fiber found in fruits and vegetables. Since an adult\\ndiet should contain 20–25 g of fiber per day , a person\\nshould find other sources of fiber. Another caution is that\\ncarrot greens, rhubarb greens, and apple seeds can be\\ntoxic and should not be juiced.\\nSome health professionals advise against fasting, a\\nprocess they say can produce weakness, fatigue , ane-\\nmia, and other disorders. Other health professionals\\nbelieve that fasts are safe but should not be undertaken\\nby pregnant women, people who are diabetic, and\\nthose who have ulcers or a heart condition. In some\\ncases, the doctor or practitioner may advise a super-\\nvised fast.\\nCritics of the Gerson diet maintain that its danger-\\nous side effects include too much weight loss and poor\\nresistance to disease. A person diagnosed with cancer\\nshould not abandon such other conventional treatments\\nas chemotherapy in favor of alternative treatment, ac-\\ncording to organizations such as the National Cancer In-\\nstitute. Furthermore, the Gerson Institute advised that\\ntherapy should be conducted under the supervision of a\\nGerson practitioner when a patient is undergoing\\nchemotherapy , is a diabetic, has severe kidney damage,\\nor has breast implants.\\nLastly , the juicing of fresh fruit and some vegetables\\ncan lead to the intake of considerable amounts of sugar.\\nIn some people, the sugar produces a quick rush of ener-\\ngy followed by a “crash. ”\\nSide effects\\nThe side effects of fasting can include weight loss\\nand fatigue.\\nIn Gerson therapy ,diarrhea and nausea are consid-\\nered part of the healing process. During the treatment, a\\nperson may experience flu-like symptoms, loss of ap-\\npetite, weakness, and dizziness . Other side effects may\\ninclude fever blisters , perspiration and body odor ,i n -\\ntestinal cramping, and a painful feeling in tumors.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nStudies of Gerson therapy indicated a higher rate of\\nsurvival for cancer patients who received the treatment in\\ncomparison to those who didn’t. That research included\\na 1995 study performed in Mexico. The therapy has not\\nbeen researched extensively , however, and the Gerson\\ndiet is classified by the National Cancer Institute as not\\nmedically proven and potentially unsafe.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21130\\nJuice therapies\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1130'),\n",

The tree grows to a\\nheight of 6-25 ft (2-8 m) and has stiff, pointed needles\\nthat grow to 0.4 in (1 cm) long. The female bears cones\\nthat produce small round bluish-black berries, which\\ntake three years to fully mature.\\nJuniper belongs to the pine family (Cupressaceae).\\nJuniper has diuretic, antiseptic, stomachic, antimicrobial,\\nanti-inflammatory , and antirheumatic properties. The\\ntree’s therapeutic properties stem from a volatile oil\\nfound in the berries. This oil contains terpenes, flavonoid\\nglycosides, tannins, sugar, tar, and resin. T erpinen-4-ol (a\\ndiuretic compound of the oil) stimulates the kidneys, in-\\ncreasing their filtration rate. The flavonoid\\namentoflavone exhibits antiviral properties. T est tube\\nstudies show that another constituent of juniper, desoxy-\\npodophyllotoxins, may act to inhibit the herpes simplex\\nvirus. The resins and tars contained in the oil benefit\\nsuch skin conditions as psoriasis.\\nFor more than 300 years, juniper berries have been a\\npopular flavoring agent for gin. The word gin comes\\nfrom the Dutch word for juniper, “geniver. ” In addition\\nto being an ingredient in alcohol, juniper also has medic-\\ninal properties.

Other Native Americans gathered juniper berries\\nand leaves to treat infections , arthritis, and wounds .\\nBritish herbalists used juniper to promote menstruation.\\nNineteenth-century American herbalists used juniper as\\na remedy for congestive heart failure, gonorrhea , and\\nurinary tract infections.\\nJuniper has also been used as a traditional remedy\\nfor cancer, arthritis, gas, indigestion, warts, bronchitis,\\ntuberculosis , gallstones , colic , heart failure, intestinal\\ndisease, gout , and back pain . The berries were often\\neaten to relieve rheumatism or to freshen bad breath .\\nWhen treating patients, doctors often chewed juniper\\nberries to prevent infection.\\nGeneral use\\nModern herbalists prescribe juniper to treat bladder\\ninfections, kidney disease, chronic arthritis, gout,\\nrheumatic conditions, fluid retention, cystitis, skin con-\\nditions, inflammation, digestive problems, menstrual ir-\\nregularities, and high blood pressure. The German Com-\\nmission E has approved juniper berries for use in treating\\nheartburn and dyspepsia (indigestion), belching, and\\nother digestive disturbances.\\nJuniper is a powerful diuretic. The volatile oil con-\\ntained in juniper is composed of compounds that stimu-\\nlate the kidneys to remove fluid and bacterial waste\\nproducts from the body . This diuretic action is useful in\\nsuch conditions as congestive heart failure, urinary infec-\\ntions, and kidney disease.\\nThe oil also has antiseptic properties, which makes it\\na useful disinfectant treatment for urinary and bladder in-\\nfections. The German Commission E reported that juniper\\ncaused an increase in urine flow and smooth muscle con-\\ntractions. Juniper may be combined with other herbs such\\nas uva ursi, parsley, cleavers, or buchu to treat bladder\\ninfections. In fact, juniper may help treat bladder infec-\\ntions more effectively when combined with other herbs.\\nJuniper’s anti-inflammatory properties help to relieve\\nthe inflammation, stiffness, and pain that are present in\\nconditions like arthritis, rheumatism, and gout. The berries\\ncan be made into an ointment and rubbed on the affected\\njoints and muscles. The tree needles may be crushed and\\nadded to a bath to ease aching muscles. Some people may\\nfind relief from the nerve, muscle, joint, and tendon pains\\nof gout and rheumatoid arthritisby applying a compress\\nmade from an infusion of juniper berries.\\nJuniper is also warming to the digestive system and\\nincreases the production of stomach acid, stimulates the\\nappetite, settles the stomach, and relieves gas.\\nA steam distillation process is used to extract the es-\\nsential oil of juniper from the ripe dried berries. This aro-\\nmatic oil has a light, fruity fragrance that is psychological-\\nly uplifting during periods of low energy , anxiety, and\\ngeneral weakness. Applied topically , essential oil of ju-\\nniper has a warming effect on the skin and helps to pro-\\nmote the removal of fluid and waste products from tissues.\\nExternal applications also help relieve sore muscles, joint\\nand lower back pain, and can be used to clear up acne,\\neczema, and varicose veins. T o stimulate menstruation, ju-\\nniper oil can be added to a carrier oil and used in a sitz bath\\nor massage. Steam inhalation of the essential oil may also\\nhelp relieve coughs and lung conditions such as bronchitis.\\nConsumers should use juniper oil sparingly and\\nshould not use more than the recommended dose. Six or\\nmore drops of juniper oil can have a toxic effect. Any\\naromatherapy essential oil should be diluted in a carrier\\noil such as almond or grapeseed oil before external use.\\nPreparations\\nThe ripe, berries and needles from the tree are used\\nin herbal medicine. Juniper is available in bulk form as\\nwhole berries, or as a supplement in the form of capsules\\nor tinctures.\\nThe recommended tincture dosage is 10-20 drops\\nfour times daily .\\nT eas are often taken to relieve digestive problems.\\nT o make a tea, 1 cup of boiling water is poured over 1\\ntablespoon of juniper berries. The mixture is covered and\\nsteeped for 10-20 minutes. One cup can be drunk two\\ntimes daily . The tea should not be used for longer than\\ntwo weeks at a time. A clean cloth may be soaked in the\\ncooled mixture to create a compress.\\nPrecautions\\nJuniper should be used only for short periods of\\ntime. High doses or prolonged use of juniper may irritate\\nthe kidneys and urinary tract, causing damage. People\\nwith kidney problems should not use this herb.\\nJuniper stimulates contractions of the womb. Preg-\\nnant women should not use juniper. Breast-feeding\\nwomen also should not use juniper.\\nJuniper may increase blood sugar levels in diabetics.\\nTherefore, diabetics should consult with their doctor be-\\nfore using juniper.\\nWhen taking juniper for a bladder infection , con-\\nsumers should see their doctor if the infection is still pre-\\nsent after several days of use, or if lower back pain,\\nfever, or chills develop.\\nSide effects\\nExternal application of juniper oil may cause a skin\\nrash.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21132\\nJuniper\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1132'),\n",

Bone, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons are all\\nforms of connective tissue that have different composi-\\ntions, and thus different characteristics.\\nThe joints are structures that hold two or more\\nbones together. Some joints (synovial joints) allow for\\nmovement between the bones being joined (articulating\\nbones). The simplest model of a synovial joint involves\\ntwo bones, separated by a slight gap called the joint cavi-\\nty . The ends of each articular bone are covered by a layer\\nof cartilage. Both the articular bones and the joint cavity\\nare surrounded by a tough tissue called the articular cap-\\nsule. The articular capsule has two components: the fi-\\nbrous membrane on the outside, and the synovial mem-\\nbrane (or synovium) on the inside. The fibrous mem-\\nbrane may include tough bands of fibrous tissue called\\nligaments, which are responsible for providing support\\nto the joints. The synovial membrane has special cells\\nand many capillaries (tiny blood vessels). This mem-\\nbrane produces a supply of synovial fluid that fills the\\njoint cavity , lubricates it, and helps the articular bones\\nmove smoothly about the joint.\\nIn JRA, the synovial membrane becomes intensely\\ninflamed. Usually thin and delicate, the synovium be-\\ncomes thick and stiff, with numerous infoldings on its\\nsurface. The membrane becomes invaded by white blood\\ncells, which produce a variety of destructive chemicals.\\nThe cartilage along the articular surfaces of the bones\\nmay be attacked and destroyed, and the bone, articular\\ncapsule, and ligaments may begin to be worn away\\n(eroded). These processes severely interfere with move-\\nment in the joint.\\nJRA specifically refers to chronic arthritic condi-\\ntions that affect a child under the age of 16 years, and\\nthat last for a minimum of three to six months. JRA is\\noften characterized by a waxing and waning course, with\\nflares separated by periods of time during which no\\nsymptoms are noted (remission).

This is called\\na contracture.\\nSymptoms of JRA depend on the particular subtype.\\nAccording to criteria published by the American College\\nof Rheumatology (ACR) in 1973 and modified in 1977,\\nJRA is classified by the symptoms that appear within the\\nfirst six months of the disorder:\\n• Pauciarticular JRA: This is the most common and the\\nleast severe type of JRA, affecting about 40–60% of all\\nJRA patients. It affects fewer than four joints, usually\\nthe knee, ankle, wrist, and/or elbow . Other more gener-\\nal (systemic) symptoms are usually absent, and the\\nchild’s growth usually remains normal. V ery few chil-\\ndren (less than 15%) with pauciarticular JRA end up\\nwith deformed joints. Some children with this form of\\nJRA experience painless swelling of the joint. Others\\nhave a serious inflammation of structures within the\\neye, which if left undiagnosed and untreated could even\\nlead to blindness. This condition is known as uveitis,\\nand affects about 20% of children diagnosed with JRA.\\nWhile many children have cycles of flares and remis-\\nsions, in some children the disease completely and per-\\nmanently resolves within a few years of diagnosis.\\n• Polyarticular JRA: About 40% of all cases of JRA are of\\nthis type. It is most common in children up to age three\\nor after the age of 10, and affects girls more often than\\nboys. Polyarticular JRA affects five or more joints si-\\nmultaneously . This type of JRA usually affects the small\\njoints of both hands and both feet, although other large\\njoints may be affected as well. Some patients with\\narthritis in their knees will experience a different rate of\\ngrowth in each leg. Ultimately , one leg will grow longer\\nthan the other. About half of all patients with polyarticu-\\nlar JRA have arthritis of the spine and/or hip. Others\\nwith polyarticular JRA will have other symptoms of a\\nsystemic illness, including anemia (low red blood cell\\ncount), decreased growth rate, low appetite, low-grade\\nfever, and a slight rash. The disease is most severe in\\nthose children who are diagnosed in early adolescence.\\nSome of these children will test positive for a marker\\npresent in other autoimmune disorders, called rheuma-\\ntoid factor (RF). RF is found in adults who have\\nrheumatoid arthritis. Children who are positive for RF\\ntend to have a more severe course, with a disabling form\\nof arthritis that destroys and deforms the joints. This\\ntype of arthritis is thought to be the adult form of\\nrheumatoid arthritis occurring at a very early age.\\n• Systemic onset JRA: Sometimes called Still disease\\n(after a physician who originally described it), this type\\nof JRA occurs in about 10–20% of all patients with\\ngenes with family members who have other autoimmune\\ndiseases like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, multi-\\nple sclerosis, and others.\\nMany researchers have looked for some infectious\\ncause for JRA, but no clear connection to a particular or-\\nganism has ever been made. JRA is considered by some\\nto be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders\\noccur when the body’s immune system mistakenly iden-\\ntifies the body’s own tissue as foreign, and attacks those\\ntissues, as if trying to rid the body of an invader (such as\\na bacteria, virus, or fungi). While an autoimmune mech-\\nanism is strongly suspected, certain markers of such a\\nmechanism (such as rheumatoid factor, often present in\\nadults with such disorders) are rarely present in children\\nwith JRA.\\nJoint symptoms of arthritis may include stiffness,\\npain, redness, warmth of the joint, and swelling.

Boys and girls are equally affected, and diagnosis\\nis usually made between the ages of five and 10. The\\ninitial symptoms are not usually related to the joints.\\nInstead, these children have high fevers; a rash; de-\\ncreased appetite and weight loss; severe joint and mus-\\ncle pain; swollen lymph nodes, spleen, and liver; and\\nserious anemia. Some children experience other com-\\nplications, including inflammation of the sac contain-\\ning the heart (pericarditis), inflammation of the tissue\\nlining the chest cavity and lungs (pleuritis), and inflam-\\nmation of the heart muscle (myocarditis). The eye in-\\nflammation often seen in pauciarticular JRA is uncom-\\nmon in systemic onset JRA. Symptoms of actual arthri-\\ntis begin later in the course of systemic onset JRA, and\\nthey often involve the wrists and ankles. Many of these\\nchildren continue to have periodic flares of fever and\\nsystemic symptoms throughout childhood. Some chil-\\ndren will go on to develop a polyarticular type of JRA.\\n• Spondyloarthropathy: This type of JRA most common-\\nly affects boys older than eight years of age. The arthri-\\ntis occurs in the knees and ankles, moving over time to\\ninclude the hips and lower spine. Inflammation of the\\neye may occur occasionally but usually resolves with-\\nout permanent damage.\\n• Psoriatic JRA: This type of arthritis usually shows up\\nin fewer than four joints, but goes on to include multi-\\nple joints (appearing similar to polyarticular JRA).\\nHips, back, fingers, and toes are frequently affected. A\\nskin condition called psoriasis accompanies this type\\nof arthritis. Children with this type of JRA often have\\npits or ridges in their fingernails. The arthritis usually\\nprogresses to become a serious, disabling problem.\\nAs of 2003, there is some disagreement among spe-\\ncialists about the classification of JRA. Some prefer the\\nEULAR classification, also introduced in 1977, to the\\nACR system. In 1997, the W orld Health Organization\\n(WHO) met in Durban and issued a new classification\\nsystem for JRA known as the Durban criteria, in an at-\\ntempt to standardize definitions of the various subtypes\\nof JRA. None of the various classification systems, how-\\never, are considered fully satisfactory as of early 2004.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of JRA is often made on the basis of the\\nchild’s collection of symptoms. Laboratory tests often\\nshow normal results. Some nonspecific indicators of in-\\nflammation may be elevated, including white blood cell\\ncount, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a marker\\ncalled C-reactive protein. As with any chronic disease,\\nanemia may be noted. Children with an extraordinarily\\nearly onset of the adult type of rheumatoid arthritis will\\nhave a positive test for rheumatoid factor.\\nT reatment\\nOne of the best natural therapies for JRA is resis-\\ntance exercises, according to a 1999 study at the Univer-\\nsity of Buffalo in New Y ork. In the study , children did\\nlower body exercises three times a week for an hour per\\nsession. After eight weeks, the children had a 40–60% in-\\ncrease in muscle strength, speed, and endurance. The less\\nfit the child, the more improvement that was shown. Also,\\npain was reduced by 50% and medication use was cut by\\n25%. In a related study , researchers found exercise de-\\ncreased inflammatory agents while increasing anti-in-\\nflammatory compounds in the body , thereby improving\\nimmune function. Diet is also believed to play a role in\\ntreating juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. A strict vegetarian\\ndiet low in fats and free of glutens can also be helpful, as\\nwell as an allergy elimination diet. A number of autoim-\\nmune disorders, including JRA, seem to have a relation-\\nship to food allergies . Identification and elimination of\\nreactive foods may result in a decrease in JRA symptoms.\\nAlternative treatments that have been suggested for\\narthritis include juice therapy, which can work to detoxi-\\nfy the body , helping to reduce JRA symptoms. Some rec-\\nommended fruits and vegetables to include in the juice\\nare carrots, celery , cabbage, potatoes, cherries, lemons,\\nbeets, cucumbers, radishes, and garlic . T omatoes and\\nother vegetables in the nightshade family (potatoes, egg-\\nplant, and red and green peppers) are discouraged. As an\\nadjunct therapy ,aromatherapy preparations use cypress,\\nfennel, and lemon. Massage oils include rosemary, ben-\\nzoin, chamomile , camphor, juniper , eucalyptus , and\\nlavender. Other types of therapy that have been used in-\\nclude acupuncture, acupressure, and body work.\\nAlso shown to be effective in some cases are the es-\\nsential fatty acids: omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil , and\\nthe omega-6 fatty acid gamma liolenic acid (GLA) found\\nin borage oil, currant seed oil, and evening primrose oil.\\nSeveral alternative medicine doctors suggest there may be\\nsome benefit in taking cartilage supplements , although\\nno definitive studies have been done on this treatment.\\nAnti-inflammatory spices such as tumeric, ginger , and\\ncayenne may be helpful. Natural remedies such as yucca,\\nburdock root , horsetail , devil’s claw , sarsaparilla, and\\nwhite willow bark also can be helpful since they have\\nanti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.\\nNutritional supplements that may be beneficial in-\\nclude large amounts of antioxidants (vitamins C, A, E,\\nzinc , selenium , and flavenoids), as well as B vitamins\\nand a full complement of minerals (including boron ,\\ncopper, manganese ).

Constitutional\\nhomeopathy can also work to quiet the symptoms of\\nJRA and bring about balance to the whole person.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nTreating JRA involves efforts to decrease the amount\\nof inflammation, in order to preserve movement. Medica-\\ntions that can be used for this include nonsteroidal anti-in-\\nflammatory agents (such as ibuprofen and naproxen). Oral\\n(by mouth) steroid medications are effective, but have\\nmany serious side effects with long-term use. Injections of\\nsteroids into an affected joint can be helpful. Steroid eye\\ndrops are used to treat eye inflammation. Other drugs that\\nhave been used to treat JRA include methotrexate, sul-\\nfasalazine, penicillamine, and hydroxychloroquine. Physi-\\ncal therapy and exercises are often recommended in order\\nto improve joint mobility and strengthen supporting mus-\\ncles. Occasionally , splints are used to rest painful joints\\nand to prevent or improve deformities.\\nThe FDA approved a new drug, etanercept, mar-\\nketed under the brand name Enbrel, in 1999. It is the\\nmost dramatic advancement in treating JRA in recent\\nyears. A study by Children’s Hospital Medical Center\\nin Cincinnati, Ohio, released in 1999, showed the drug\\nwas effective in 75% of children with severe JRA. The\\ndrug eases joint pain, reduces swelling, and improves\\nmobility .\\nIn 2003, a group of Japanese researchers noted that\\nthe blood serum of patients with JRA contains elevated\\nlevels of interleukin-6, a cytokine (nonantibody protein)\\nthat is critical to regulation of the immune system and\\nblood cell formation. Because interleukin-6 is also asso-\\nciated with inflammation, the researchers think that com-\\npounds inhibiting the formation of interleukin-6 might\\nprovide new treatment options for JRA.\\nExpected results\\nThe prognosis for pauciarticular JRA is quite good,\\nas is the prognosis for spondyloarthropathy . Polyarticu-\\nlar JRA carries a slightly worse prognosis. RF-positive\\npolyarticular JRA carries a difficult prognosis, often\\nwith progressive, destructive arthritis and joint deformi-\\nties. Systemic onset JRA has a variable prognosis, de-\\npending on the organ systems affected, and the progres-\\nsion to polyarticular JRA. About 1–5% of all JRA pa-\\ntients die of such complications as infection, inflamma-\\ntion of the heart, or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nLittle is known about the causes of JRA, therefore\\nthere are no recommendations available for preventing it.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBehrman, Richard, et al., eds.

It is also used as a homeopathic\\nremedy . In homeopathy, potassium bichromate is dilut-\\ned to the point where it no longer retains any poisonous\\nor caustic qualities. Homeopaths usually abbreviate kali\\nbichromium as Kali bich. or as Kali bi.\\nGeneral use\\nHomeopathic medicine operates on the principle\\nthat “like heals like. ” This principle means that a disease\\ncan be cured by treating it with products that produce the\\nsame symptoms as the disease. These products follow\\nanother homeopathic law , the Law of Infinitesimals. In\\nopposition to traditional medicine, the Law of Infinitesi-\\nmals states that the lower a dose of curative, the more ef-\\nfective it is. T o achieve a low dose, the curative is diluted\\nmany , many times until only a tiny amount, if any , re-\\nmains in a huge amount of the diluting liquid.\\nIn homeopathic medicine, Kali bichromium is said to\\nhave an affinity for the mucous membranes and the skin.\\nIt is used primarily to treat stringy yellowish or greenish\\nmucous discharges from any part of the body , including\\nthe nose, throat, larynx, vagina, urethra, and stomach. Its\\nmost common use is to treat colds that are accompanied\\nby sinus congestion or evolve into sinusitis.\\nIn these situations the patient feels pressure and full-\\nness in the sinuses and experiences extreme pain at the\\nroot of the nose that improves when pressure is applied\\nto the painful spot. Kali bichromium is also used to treat\\nfeelings of fullness and pressure in the middle ear and to\\ntreat sinus or migraine headaches that start at night.\\nIn addition, Kali bichromium is used to treat a sore\\nthroat with swollen tonsils, swollen neck, and a dis-\\ncharge of pus. In the mouth, ulcers or a dry , burning feel-\\ning are treated by Kali bichromium when accompanied\\nby intense pain at the root of the tongue or a dry , yellow-\\ncoated tongue.\\nCertain types of coughs are also treated with Kali\\nbichromium when the voice is rough and hoarse, and the\\ncough is dry . If the cough worsens when breathing damp,\\ncold air, worsens in the early hours of the morning, and is\\nbetter in warm air, these are also indications to the home-\\nopath that kali bichromium is an appropriate remedy .\\nKali bichromium is used to treat joint pains that ap-\\npear and disappear suddenly or wander to different spots\\nin the body causing severe pain. These pains, like the\\ncough, are improved by warmth.\\nKali bichromium is sometimes used for relief of dis-\\ntress in the digestive system such as nausea and vomit-\\ning of yellow mucus and bile. In homeopathic terminolo-\\ngy , the effectiveness of remedies is proved by experi-\\nmentation and reporting done by famous homeopathic\\npractitioners. Kali bichromium was proved as a vomiting\\nremedy by Dr. John H. Clark (1853–1931).\\nIn homeopathic medicine the fact that certain symp-\\ntoms get better or worse under different conditions is\\nused as a diagnostic tool to indicate what remedy will be\\nmost effective. Symptoms that benefit from treatment\\nwith Kali bichromium get worse in the very early hours\\nof the morning (2 a.m. to 5 a.m.), worsen in wet weather,\\nare worse in the summer, are worse upon awaking, upon\\ngetting cold from undressing, and upon consuming alco-\\nhol (which often induces vomiting and diarrhea in pa-\\ntients that need this remedy). Symptoms improve with\\nwarmth, movement, pressure, and from eating. Patients\\nneeding Kali bichromium tend to get cold easily .\\nHomeopathy also ascribes certain personality types\\nto certain remedies. The  Kali bichromium personality is\\nsaid to be listless with aversion to physical or mental ex-\\nercise . People with Kali bichromium personalities also\\ntend to be rigid and inflexible, doing most activities such\\nas eating, sleeping, and working on a rigid timetable.\\nThey are very detail oriented.

In recent years, there has\\nbeen a considerable resurgence of Kampo’s popularity .\\nBenefits\\nKampo preparations are used to treat a wide variety of\\nconditions, including eczema, atopic dermatitis, and gyne-\\ncological problems. Other applications include allergies,\\nrheumatoid arthritis, chronic hepatitis, diabetic retinopa-\\nthy , bronchial asthma, endometrial cancer, collagen disease,\\nbedwetting, colds,nausea, and high cholesterol  levels.\\nDescription\\nLike other forms of Oriental traditional medicine,\\nKampo is based on concepts quite foreign to W estern\\nmedical thinking. These concepts include In-Y ou(nega-\\ntive and positive); Gogyou (five lines); Ki (air); Sui\\n(water); and Ketu (blood). Unlike W estern medicine,\\nwhich thinks largely in terms of diseases affecting spe-\\ncific organs, Kampo emphasizes identifying patterns of\\n“whole body” symptoms.\\nKampo herbal treatments are divided into three basic\\ngroups, related to urination, sweating, and defecation. Most\\nprescriptions consist of a combination of crude drugs used\\nto treat whatever disharmony is detected. Kampo remedies\\nusually take longer to work than standard pharmaceuticals.\\nA typical trial period for a new prescription is three months.\\nPatients may continue taking some prescriptions for years.\\nExamples of crude drugs used in Kampo preparations in-\\nclude glycyrrhiza (licorice), rhubarb, and ginseng.\\nSince the 1970s, Kampo has been recognized by\\nJapan’s medical regulators, and Kampo herbs are includ-\\ned in the list of reimbursable drugs under the country’s\\nnational health insurance plan. During the 1990s and\\ncontinuing into the new millennium, Japanese officials\\nrequired recertification of a number of Kampo drugs, in-\\nsisting that their safety and effectiveness be reevaluated.\\nJapanese pharmacists are allowed to manufacture a limit-\\ned number of drugs themselves. Of these licensed prod-\\nucts, 50% are Kampo products, according to the Japan\\nPharmaceutical Association.\\nPrecautions\\nAs with all Oriental herbal remedies, persons should\\nuse only Kampo preparations obtained from a reliable\\nsource. Serious problems have arisen when Oriental herbal\\nprescriptions were misidentified or contained adulterants.\\nThe Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine in the United\\nKingdom recommends that patent medicines mixing W est-\\nern and Oriental herbs be avoided, together with any patent\\npreparation containing heavy metals. Some patients have\\ndeveloped hepatitis after taking patent-medicine tablets\\nbased on traditional Oriental formulas. An investigation re-\\nvealed that the tablets did not contain the complete herb,\\nbut rather a chemical isolated from a single herb. This\\npractice contradicts the most basic principles of Oriental\\ntraditional medicine, which uses combinations of whole\\nherbs. Because of Kampo’s complexity , self-treatment is\\nusually not advised; consulting a knowledgeable practi-\\ntioner is essential. Some patients have experienced serious,\\neven fatal, kidney or liver problems after treatment with\\nOriental herbs. Anyone with a history of disease in those\\norgans should not be treated without accompanying blood\\ntests to monitor their function. It has also been suggested\\nthat patients who consume considerable amounts of alco-\\nhol should receive liver function tests. It is important that\\npatients be monitored after starting Oriental herb treat-\\nments to check for signs of liver or kidney problems.\\nSide effects\\nBecause Kampo and other forms of Oriental tradi-\\ntional medicine are so old, practitioners say that most side\\neffects were identified long ago and so are easily avoided\\nby an experienced practitioner. Some Oriental herbal\\npreparations, however, are known toxins that continue to\\nbe prescribed because of their beneficial effects. These\\nmust be used with extreme care, employing only low\\ndoses under the direction of a highly competent and certi-\\nfied practitioner. In most cases, these preparations should\\nbe used only in a hospital setting. In addition, some people\\nmay have an allergic hypersensitivity to certain herbs.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nIn Japan, Kampo treatment is studied and frequently\\nprescribed by medical doctors. As many as 70% of\\nJapanese gynecologists are said to employ Kampo, par-\\nticularly in menopausal patients.\\nT raining & certification\\nIn Japan, Kampo drugs are widely available from\\nmedical doctors and pharmacists. In the rest of the\\nworld, Kampo preparations and practitioners are largely\\nunregulated.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nBlackwell, Richard. “ Adverse events following certain Chinese\\nherbal medicines and the response of the profession. ”\\nJournal of Chinese Medicine. 50:12.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1141\\nKampo medicine\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1141'),\n",

Al-\\nternatives are radiation therapy , electrical curettage, in\\nwhich the lesion is burned with an electrical current, or\\ncryotherapy , in which a source of extreme cold, such as\\nliquid nitrogen, is applied to the cancer in order to kill\\nthe cells.\\nAmong patients who develop KS after an organ\\ntransplant, reduction in the dose of drugs used to control\\nthe immune response may be enough to control or elimi-\\nnate the cancer, although this treatment increases the risk\\nof transplant rejection. One report from the University of\\nBarcelona in Spain states that a change of medication\\nmay resolve the problem of KS after transplantation.\\nIn KS associated with AIDS, systemic chemothera-\\npy is usually required.\\nThe Gay Men’s Health Crisis (GMHC) has reviewed\\na number of alternative therapies which have been tried\\nin KS, but none have shown consistently favorable re-\\nsults.

KS is seen in three forms:\\n• indolent\\n• lymphadenopathic\\n• AIDS-related\\nThe primary distinction between the three forms of\\nKS is the rate of growth and the location of the lesions.\\nIn the past, the indolent form of Kaposi’s sarcoma was\\nthe most common, and was most often seen in men over\\nthe age of 60 years of Jewish or Italian ancestry; in\\nAfrican men; and in patients who had organ transplants\\nor had their immune systems impaired for other reasons.\\nKS was frequently left untreated. Because of its slow\\ngrowth, the cancer was not a threat to the patient. Since\\nthe 1980s, a far higher percentage of cases with rapid\\ngrowth have been observed, usually accompanied by\\nAIDS (HIV disease).\\nThe aggressive form of KS is seen in about one-\\nthird of patients with AIDS, and has become endemic in\\nequatorial African. In African nations, aggressive KS is\\nseen most often among young men and children.\\nLymphadenophic KS affects the lymph nodes as\\nwell as the skin structures.\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1142'),\n",

Kava kava be-\\nlongs to the pepper family (Piperaceae) and is also\\nknown as kava, asava pepper, or intoxicating pepper. It\\ngrows to an average height of 6 ft (1.83 m) and has large\\nheart-shaped leaves that can grow to 10 in (25.4 cm)\\nwide. A related species is Piper sanctum , a native plant\\nof Mexico that is used as a stimulant.\\nKava kava has been used as a medicinal herb for\\nhundreds of years and used by Pacific Islanders to treat\\nrheumatism, asthma , worms, obesity , headaches, fun-\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThere are no current best-practice treatments for\\nKS. For rapidly growing KS, a standard treatment is sys-\\ntemic chemotherapy with a combination of adriamycin,\\nbleomycin, and vincristine (ABV); however, several\\nstudies have reported that single-agent treatments may\\nbe as effective as combinations. Single-agent treatments\\nthat have shown evidence of effectiveness are a liposo-\\nmal form of adriamycin used alone; methotrexate, and\\ntrimetrexate. Interferon-alpha has also been reported to\\nbe effective in AIDS-related KS.\\nExpected results\\nThe expected results depend primarily on the under-\\nlying condition of the patient. Those patients who have\\nclassic slow-growing KS may live many years, even in\\nthe absence of treatment. For patients with AIDS, a pro-\\nposed staging system has divided patients into low-and\\nhigh-risk groups, depending both on the extent of the\\nsarcoma and their underlying immune function. Patients\\nwith well-functioning immune systems, no AIDS associ-\\nated opportunistic infections , and KS confined to the\\nskin have an estimated survival of about three years.\\nThose with impaired immune systems, other infections,\\nand more widespread KS have an estimated survival of\\nabout one year. Overall length of survival will depend on\\nthe patient’s response to treatment.\\nPrevention\\nThe United States Public Health Service (USPHS)\\nguidelines for prevention of KS call for prophylactic ad-\\nministration of drugs that are effective against human\\nherpesvirus-8. The primary drugs for this purpose are\\nfoscarnet and ganciclovir. In each case, the dose must be\\nadjusted based on the patient’s condition. While the\\nUSPHS recognizes that KS may affect children as well\\nas adults, no formal recommendations for prevention\\nhave been published.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAbeloff M. D., J. O. Armitage, A.

Kavalactones also have analgesic\\n(pain-relieving) properties that may bring relief to sore\\nthroats, sore gums, canker sores, and toothaches.\\nKava kava is a strong diuretic that is reportedly benefi-\\ncial in the treatment of gout, rheumatism, and arthritis. The\\ndiuretic effect of the herb relieves pain and helps remove\\nwaste products from the afflicted joints. Antispasmodic prop-\\nerties have shown to help ease menstrual cramps by relaxing\\nthe muscles of the uterus. Kava kava’s antiseptic and anti-in-\\nflammatory agents may help relieve an irritable bladder, uri-\\nnary tract infections, and inflammation of the prostate gland.\\nPreparations\\nKava kava is available in dry bulk (powdered or\\ncrushed), capsule, tablet, tea, and tincture forms. Many of\\nthe products are made from the dried powder of the root.\\nW estern consumers have generally been advised to look for\\nstandardized extracts of kava kava that have a 70% kavalac-\\ntone content. On the other hand, a report submitted to the\\nCommittee of Safety of Medicines (CSM) of the United\\nKingdom in April 2002 indicates that many of the side ef-\\nfects reported in connection with kava kava are due to the\\nhigh concentration of the herb in commercial standardized\\nextracts. The report suggested that kava preparations made\\naccording to traditional methods are relatively safe. It is like-\\nly that controversy over kava kava will continue.\\nPrecautions\\nBefore 2002, the usual precautions regarding kava\\nkava stated that it should not be used by pregnant or lac-\\ntating women, or when driving or operating heavy ma-\\nchinery . The American Herbal Products Association\\n(AHP A) advised consumers in 1997 not to take kava\\nkava for more than three months at a time, and not to ex-\\nceed the recommended dosages. In light of more recent\\nfindings, however, it would be prudent for many adults\\nto completely avoid preparations of or products contain-\\ning kava kava.\\nAs of March 25, 2002, the United States Food and\\nDrug Administration (FDA) has recommended that peo-\\nple who have a history of liver disease or are taking med-\\nications that affect the liver should consult a physician\\nbefore taking any preparations containing kava kava.\\nSide effects\\nPrior to 2002, most reports of side effects from kava\\nkava concerned relatively minor problems, such as\\nnumbness in the mouth, headaches, mild dizziness ,o r\\ngal infections , leprosy , gonorrhea, vaginal infections ,\\nurinary infections, menstrual problems, migraine\\nheadaches, and insomnia. It was also used as a diuretic,\\nan aphrodisiac, to promote energy , and to bring about\\nsweating during colds and fevers. Pacific Islanders con-\\nsume a kava kava drink at social, ritual, and ceremonial\\nfunctions. It is drunk at ceremonies to commemorate\\nmarriages, births, and deaths; in meetings of village el-\\nders; as an offering to the gods; to cure illness; and to\\nwelcome honored guests. Pope John Paul II, Queen Eliz-\\nabeth II, and Hillary Rodham Clinton have all drunk\\nkava kava during their island visits.\\nThe drink is prepared by grinding, grating, or\\npounding the roots of the plant, then soaking the pulp in\\ncold water or coconut milk. Traditionally the root was\\nchewed, spit into a bowl, and mixed with coconut milk\\nor water. That practice is no longer the standard.\\nCaptain James Cook has been credited with the\\nW estern discovery of kava kava during his journey to the\\nSouth Pacific in the late 1700s.

Nineteenth-century missionaries to the Pa-\\ncific islands noted that people who drank large quantities\\nof kava kava developed yellowish scaly skin. A more re-\\ncent study found the same side effect in test subjects who\\ntook 100 times the recommended dose of the plant.\\nAs of 2002, however, kava kava has been associated\\nwith serious side effects involving damage to the liver,\\nincluding hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. Most of\\nthe research on kava kava has been done in Europe,\\nwhere the herb is even more popular than it is in the\\nUnited States. By the late fall of 2001, there had been at\\nleast 25 reports from different European countries con-\\ncerning liver damage caused by the plant. French health\\nagencies reported one death and four patients requiring\\nliver transplants in connection with kava kava consump-\\ntion. On December 19, 2001, the MedW atch advisory of\\nthe U. S. Food and Drug Administration posted health\\nwarnings about the side effects of kava kava; and on Jan-\\nuary 16, 2002, Health Canada advised Canadians to\\navoid all products containing the herb. France banned the\\nsale of preparations containing kava kava in February\\n2002. The U. S. National Center for Complementary and\\nAlternative Medicine (NCCAM) put two research stud-\\nies of kava kava on hold while awaiting further action by\\nthe FDA. NCCAM advised consumers in the United\\nStates on January 7, 2002 to avoid products containing\\nkava. On March 25, 2002, the FDA issued a consumer\\nadvisory and a letter to health care professionals con-\\ncerning the risk of severe liver damage from the use of\\nproducts containing kava kava. While the most recent ac-\\ntions on the part of the FDA stop short of banning kava\\nproducts from the U. S. market, the agency asks con-\\nsumers as well as medical practitioners to notify its Med-\\nW atch hotline of any liver damage or other injuries asso-\\nciated with using kava kava. The MedW atch toll-free\\nnumber is (800) 332-1088.\\nIn addition to causing liver damage, kava kava ap-\\npears to produce psychological side effects in some pa-\\ntients. Beverages containing kava kava have been report-\\ned to cause anxiety , depression , and insomnia. In addi-\\ntion, kava kava has caused tremors severe enough to be\\nmistaken for symptoms of Parkinson’s disease in sus-\\nceptible patients.\\nInteractions\\nKava kava has been shown to interact with beverage\\nalcohol and with several categories of prescription med-\\nications. It increases the effect of barbiturates and other\\npsychoactive medications; in one case study , a patient\\nwho took kava kava together with alprazolam went into a\\ncoma. It may produce dizziness and other unpleasant\\nside effects if taken together with phenothiazines (med-\\nications used to treat schizophrenia). Kava kava has also\\nbeen reported to reduce the effectiveness of levodopa, a\\ndrug used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.\\nSome interactions between kava kava and prescrip-\\ntion medications, as well as some of the herb’s side ef-\\nfects, have been attributed to synergy (combined effects)\\namong the various chemicals contained in kava kava\\nrather than to any one component by itself.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCass, M.D., Hyla, and T errence McNally .

Frey , PhD\\nKegel exercises\\nDefinition\\nKegel exercises (Kegels) are exercises designed to\\nstrengthen the muscles of the lower pelvic girdle, or\\npelvic floor—the pubococcygeal (PC) muscles. The PC\\nmuscles support the bladder, urethra, and urethral\\nsphincter—the muscle group at the neck of the bladder\\nthat acts as a spigot for controlling urine flow into the\\nurethra—and the vagina, uterus, and rectum. Anything\\nthat puts pressure on the abdomen can weaken or dam-\\nage these pelvic muscles. Such conditions include preg-\\nnancy , childbirth , excess weight, hormonal changes,\\nand aging. Kegel exercises enable the PC muscles to bet-\\nter withstand increases in intra-abdominal pressure\\n(pressure inside the abdomen). They make the bladder,\\nurethra, and vagina more resilient, and improve bladder\\ncontrol and sexual relations.\\nThirteen to 20 million American women suffer from\\nurinary incontinence , primarily stress urinary inconti-\\nnence (SUI)—urine leakage while laughing, coughing,\\nsneezing , standing up suddenly , or exercising. SUI oc-\\ncurs when intra-abdominal pressure increases and the\\nurethral sphincter opens inappropriately . During pregnan-\\ncy , the fetus puts pressure on the bladder and the sphinc-\\nter may relax and leak. Postpartum incontinence may re-\\nsult from muscle and nerve damage during childbirth due\\nto delivery of a large baby , prolonged labor, excessive\\npushing, a forceps delivery , or an episiotomy (an incision\\nmade during delivery to prevent tearing of maternal tis-\\nsue). About 40% of American women suffer from incon-\\ntinence after childbirth, and the incidence increases by\\nabout 12% following each birth. Childbirth also increases\\nthe risk for incontinence later in life. During menopause,\\nas a result of lower levels of estrogen, women with SUI\\nmay have thinning of the lining of the outer urethra, a\\nsensation of having to urinate often, and recurrent urinary\\ntract infections (UTIs).

Kegel, a Los Angeles-area ob-\\nstetrician and gynecologist, was having his patients prac-\\ntice vaginal contractions in preparation for childbirth.\\nThat same year he invented the Kegel perineometer, or\\npelvic-muscle sensor, to help prevent urinary inconti-\\nnence (leakage) following childbirth.\\nKegel’s perineometer was the first biofeedback ma-\\nchine designed for clinical use. Employing a vaginal sen-\\nsor, an air-pressure balloon, and a tire gauge, it enabled\\npatients to verify that they were performing Kegel’s cor-\\nrectly and to monitor their progress. The patients contin-\\nued their practice at home. Kegel published numerous\\npapers on his work and claimed to have cured inconti-\\nnence in 93% of 3,000 patients. He produced a docu-\\nmentary movie to teach the procedure to other physi-\\ncians. However, his perineometer was never marketed ef-\\nfectively and there was a widespread misconception that\\nKegels could not be performed without it. In the 1970s,\\nmore sensitive electromyography (EMG) perineometers\\nbecame available for those with severely debilitated\\npelvic muscles.\\nBenefits\\nKegel exercises strengthen the PC muscles and in-\\ncrease blood flow and nerve supply to the pelvic region,\\npromoting or resulting in:\\n• increased pelvic support\\n• restoration of vaginal muscle tone and improved vagi-\\nnal health\\n• protection from the physical stresses of childbirth\\n• restoration of sexual function and improved sexual re-\\nsponse and pleasure\\n• increased vaginal-wall thickness and lubrication after\\nmenopause (cessation of menstruation)\\n• prevention or reversal of urinary leakage and rectal in-\\ncontinence\\n• relief from pelvic pain or pain of vulvar vestibulitis\\n(inflammation of the vaginal opening)\\nDescription\\nLocating the PC muscles\\nThe PC muscles can be felt by:\\n• stopping and starting urine flow to identify the forward\\nPCs\\n• squeezing the vagina to identify the back of the PCs\\n• squeezing around two fingers placed in the vagina\\n• imagining sucking a marble up the vagina\\n• preventing a bowel movement or the passing of gas by\\ntightening the muscles around the anus\\nThere is a pulling sensation when the correct mus-\\ncles are contracted. W eaker and stronger contractions are\\npracticed until the PC muscles can be squeezed at will.\\nPracticing Kegels\\nThere are numerous suggestions for practicing\\nKegels, which include:\\n• Contracting the PC muscles for three to 10 seconds and\\nrelaxing them three to 10 seconds for five to 15 repeti-\\ntions, three to 12 times per day .\\n• Contracting the PC muscles strongly for one second,\\nthen releasing for one second, 20 times, three times per\\nday , speeding up the contractions until there is a flut-\\ntery sensation.\\n• While emptying the bladder, stopping the urine flow at\\nleast three seconds, 10 times during each urination,\\nwhich provides 60–80 contractions per day .\\nThe complete exercise requires muscle contraction\\nfrom back to front. It may take three to eight weeks for\\nnoticeable improvement. Once good muscle tone is\\nachieved, Kegels may be performed just once a day .\\nThe PC muscles can be exercised at almost any\\ntime—while lying down, sitting (in the car at a stop light,\\nat work, etc.), squatting, standing, or walking— and vary-\\ning the exercise position is said to be most effective. Sit-\\nting or standing adds weight to the exercise. It may be\\nhelpful to perform a Kegel squeeze before coughing,\\nstanding up, or lifting a heavy object. It may also be help-\\nful to incorporate Kegels into a daily routine and keep a\\nlog. It is recommended that pregnant women practice\\nKegels regularly before, as well as after, childbirth.\\nSqueezing with two fingers in the vagina will con-\\nfirm that only the vaginal muscles are contracting. Plac-\\ning a hand on the lower abdomen is a reminder to keep\\nthe belly soft and relaxed, to refrain from tightening\\nother muscles such as the stomach, buttocks, or leg mus-\\ncles, or to hold the breath, all of which increase intra-ab-\\ndominal pressure, working against the Kegels.\\nV aginal cones\\nKegels can be performed by the ancient Chinese\\ntechnique of placing a weighted cone in the vagina and\\nholding it in place up to 15 minutes twice a day . The\\npractice is initiated using the heaviest cone that can be\\nheld easily for one minute. The cones weigh from\\n15–100 gm (0.04–0.3 lb).

When combined with massive quantities of di-\\netary supplements and freeze-dried pancreatic enzymes,\\ntogether with a “detoxification” process involving coffee\\nenemas, it is said to slow the growth of cancer tumors.\\nOrigins\\nThe Kelley-Gonzalez regimen is based on a belief\\nthat enzymes from the pancreas are capable, like\\nchemotherapy , of killing cancer cells. The use of pancre-\\natic enzymes to treat cancer was first proposed in 1906\\nby John Beard, a Scottish embryologist. This idea re-\\nceived some attention at the time but was largely aban-\\ndoned after Beard died in 1923. During the 1960s, the\\nconcept was resurrected by William Donald Kelley , a\\ncontroversial dentist from Grapevine, T exas. Kelley\\nwrote a book titled One Answer to Cancer that outlined\\nhis five-pronged approach:\\n• Nutritional therapy: Beef pancreatic enzymes com-\\nbined with numerous other dietary supplements.\\n• Diet: A carefully individualized diet, ranging all the\\nway from vegetarian to all-meat.\\n• Detoxification: As few as three or as many as 52 weeks\\nof enemas and laxative purging.\\n• Neurological stimulation: V arious manipulations in-\\ncluding chiropractic , osteopathic, mandibular, and\\nphysiotherapeutic.\\n• Spiritual therapy: Prayer and Bible reading.\\nIn 1981, Nicholas Gonzalez, then a second-year\\nmedical student at Cornell University , began a five-year\\ninvestigation of Kelley’s work. Reviewing 10,000 patient\\nrecords and interviewing 500 cancer patients, Gonzalez\\nbecame convinced that many of Kelley’s patients had\\nsurvived significantly longer than would otherwise have\\nbeen expected. “Despite the careful documentation and\\nthe five-year investment of time, my attempts at publica-\\ntion were met with scorn and ridicule, ” Gonzalez recalls.\\n“It seemed no one in academic medicine could, at the\\ntime, accept that a nutritional therapy might produce\\npositive results with advanced cancer patients. ”\\nIn 1987, Gonzalez started practicing medicine in\\nNew Y ork City and developing his own cancer regimen\\nsimilar to Kelley’s, except that he rejected the neurologi-\\ncal and spiritual aspects of Kelley’s treatment.

In addi-\\ntion, he uses variations of the Gonzalez regimen to treat\\na range of other illnesses, including chronic fatigue syn-\\ndrome, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.\\nDescription\\nAs currently practiced by Gonzalez, the regimen in-\\ncludes pancreatic enzymes taken orally every four hours\\nand at meals for 16 days. Patients also take as many as\\n150 dietary supplements a day , including vitamins, min-\\nerals, magnesium citrate, papaya, trace elements, and\\nglandular products from animals. Patients also receive\\nfrequent coffee enemas. They are placed on a strict diet\\nincluding large quantities of fresh fruits, vegetable juices,\\ncereals, and as many as 20 almonds a day . Red meat,\\nwhite sugar, chicken, refined grain products, and soy are\\nall forbidden. Fish is allowed only in limited quantities.\\nPrecautions\\nThe Kelley-Gonzalez diet is considered a highly ex-\\nperimental treatment for cancer, with only limited evi-\\ndence of its effectiveness. It should therefore be under-\\ntaken only with competent medical advice and monitor-\\ning. Prospective patients should be aware that the diet re-\\nquires considerable commitment and can almost be\\nconsidered a full-time job. Initially , it can involve as\\nmany as eight enemas a day , as well as preparing four\\nservings of fresh carrot juice and taking dietary supple-\\nments 10 times a day .\\nSide effects\\nAt least two deaths have been linked to coffee ene-\\nmas, attributed to hyponatremia and dehydration.

Since kelp is such a valuable source\\nof nutrients, it is often recommended as a dietary supple-\\nment, particularly for people with mineral deficiencies.\\nOrigins\\nDifferent kinds of kelp have been eaten for nutri-\\ntional value for over a thousand years. The Chinese used\\nkelp and other types of seaweed as medicine as far back\\nas 3,000 \\nB.C. The Greeks used kelp to feed their cattle\\naround the first century B.C. Kelp has been a staple food\\nof Icelanders for centuries, and ancient Hawaiian nobles\\ngrew gardens of edible seaweed. Kelp was also used in\\nEurope and Great Britain as fertilizer to nourish soil and\\nassist plant growth.\\nThe largest consumer of kelp, however, has been\\nJapan. The Japanese have incorporated kelp and seaweed\\ninto their diets for 1,500 years. During the seventh to\\nninth centuries, only the Japanese nobility consumed\\nseaweed. In the seventeenth century , Japan began farm-\\ning seaweed. The Japanese and other Asian cultures used\\nkelp to treat uterine problems, genital tract disorders, and\\nkidney , bladder, and prostate ailments.\\nKelp is still an integral part of the Japanese diet. The\\nJapanese include kelp in almost every meal, using it in\\ncoastlines, including those of the northwestern United\\nStates and northern Europe. There are several varieties of\\nkelp: true kelp, which thrives in cool seas; giant kelp,\\nand bladder kelp, which grow in the North Pacific. Giant\\nkelp is so named because it grows to 213 ft (65 m). Kelp\\nanchors itself to rocky surfaces via tentacle-like roots.\\nFrom these roots grows a slender stalk with long, leaf-\\nlike blades.\\nKelp belongs to the Fucaceae family . Other names\\nfor Fucus vesiculosus are kelpware, black-tang, bladder-\\nfucus, cutweed, and bladderwrack. The main con-\\nstituents of kelp include phenolic compounds, mu-\\ncopolysaccharides, algin, polar lipids, and glycosyl ester\\ndiglycerides. Kelp also contains protein, carbohydrates,\\nand essential fatty acids.\\nKelp contains approximately 30 minerals. It is a rich\\nsource of iodine , calcium , sulfur , and silicon. Other\\nminerals include phosphorus, iron, sodium, potassium,\\nmagnesium , chloride, copper , zinc , manganese , bari-\\num, boron, chromium, lithium, nickel, silver, titanium,\\nvanadium , aluminum, strontium, bismuth, chlorine,\\ncobalt, gallium, tin, and zirconium.

Noodles made from kelp are a staple of the Japan-\\nese diet. Until recently , kelp was eaten almost exclusive-\\nly by the Japanese. Now the W estern population is begin-\\nning to take note of this nutrient-rich seaweed. However,\\nFucus vesiculosus is not the kind of kelp that is eaten.\\nEating dietary kelp may be responsible for the low\\nrate of breast cancer among Japanese women, and also\\nfor the low rate of heart disease , respiratory disease,\\nrheumatism, arthritis, high blood pressure, and gastroin-\\ntestinal ailments. The occurrence of thyroid disease is\\nalso low in Japan.\\nGeneral use\\nMany herbalist and naturopathic physicians recom-\\nmend Fucus vesiculosus to treat thyroid disorders, arthri-\\ntis, rheumatism, constipation , colds, high blood pres-\\nsure, colitis, eczema , goiter, obesity , low vitality , poor\\ndigestion, nervous disorders, menstrual irregularities,\\nglandular disorders, and water retention.\\nFucus vesiculosus has a therapeutic effect on many\\nsystems of the body . It strengthens immune system func-\\ntion and increases resistance to infection and fever. Kelp\\nis also beneficial to the nervous and endocrine systems.\\nIt enhances the function of the adrenal, thyroid, and pitu-\\nitary glands, and supports brain health and function.\\nOne of the main therapeutic uses of Fucus vesiculo-\\nsus is for thyroid conditions such as hypothyroidism and\\ngoiter. Partly due to its high iodine content, this kind of\\nkelp assists in the production of thyroid hormones, which\\nhelp regulate the thyroid gland. People who don’t eat\\ndairy products, seafood, and salt may develop an iodine\\ndeficiency , which may result in low thyroid function. Kelp\\nis a good source of iodine for those who may be deficient.\\nThyroid hormones are also necessary to maintain a\\nnormal metabolism. Fucus vesiculosus helps boost me-\\ntabolism, which helps to sustain normal weight (espe-\\ncially in people who are overweight because of a thyroid\\ncondition).\\nThis type of kelp is also used to rid the body of and\\nkeep it from absorbing harmful chemicals, toxins, car-\\ncinogens, and such heavy metal pollutants as barium and\\ncadmium. Algin, a fiber-like extract of kelp, helps pre-\\nvent the body from assimilating these elements. Algin is\\nused industrially in the production of tires and as an\\nagent that prevents ice cream from crystallizing. Kelp\\nalso helps to prevent the body from absorbing radioac-\\ntive elements such as strontium 90, a dangerous radioac-\\ntive substance created by nuclear power plants. However,\\nsince Fucus vesiculosus absorbs toxic chemicals, it must\\nbe harvested from clean waters or it may contain toxins.\\nKelp also reduces cholesterol levels by inhibiting bile\\nacid absorption. The diuretic effect of kelp is beneficial to\\nan irritated or infected bladder since it helps to flush out\\nharmful bacteria. Kelp helps reduce inflammation in injured\\ntissues and ease painful joints in rheumatism and rheuma-\\ntoid arthritis. Kelp may also reduce an enlarged prostate in\\nmen, and is also used to strengthen fingernails, prevent hair\\nloss, and regenerate hair if the follicle is still alive.\\nIn addition to its medicinal uses, kelp contains nat-\\nural antioxidants that make it useful to the food industry\\nin retarding spoilage. The cosmetics industry is also\\nstudying the effects of a gel derived from kelp in improv-\\ning the elasticity of human skin.\\nPreparations\\nThe kelp used medicinally in modern times is gener-\\nally harvested in kelp farms. These farms help preserve\\nthe natural balance of the sea, which is disrupted when\\nlarge amounts of naturally growing seaweed are re-\\nmoved. Farming kelp also helps to ensure that the kelp\\nretains its nutritional value. Kelp loses valuable nutrients\\nwhen it is washed ashore. When kelp is harvested, it is\\ncut, dried, then ground into powder. It is this powder that\\nis encapsulated or pressed into tablets.\\nKelp is available in bulk form either dried or as a\\nground powder. It is also sold as granules, capsules,\\ntablets, or tinctures. Granulated or powdered kelp can be\\nadded to food as a salt substitute.\\nThe recommended daily dose for adults is 10–15\\nmg. Kelp can also be made into a tea. T o create an infu-\\nsion, 1 cup of boiling water is poured over 2-3 tsp of\\ndried or powdered kelp. The tea is steeped for 10 min-\\nutes, and can be drunk three times daily .\\nPrecautions\\nPeople should not gather wild kelp because it may\\ncontain contaminants absorbed from the sea.\\nPeople with high blood pressure or a history of thy-\\nroid problems should consult their healthcare practition-\\ner before using kelp. The high sodium content of Fucus\\nvesiculosus may make high blood pressure worse. Kelp\\nisn’t recommended for people on a low-sodium diet.\\nExcessive consumption of kelp can provide the body\\nwith too much iodine and interfere with thyroid function.\\nConsumers should use it only as directed.\\nSide effects\\nThere are no known side effects, but some people\\nmay be sensitive or allergic to kelp. Common allergic\\nsymptoms include mild stomachache.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21152\\nKelp\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1152'),\n",

Kidney\\nstones cause problems when they block the flow of urine\\nthrough or out of the kidney . When the stones move\\nthrough the ureter, they cause severe pain.\\nDescription\\nUrine is formed by the kidneys. Blood flows into the\\nkidneys, and nephrons (specialized tubes) within the kid-\\nneys allow a certain amount of fluid from the blood, and\\ncertain substances dissolved in that fluid, to flow out of\\nthe body as urine. Sometimes, a problem causes the dis-\\nsolved substances to become solid again. Tiny crystals\\nmay form in the urine, meet, and cling together to create\\na larger solid mass called a kidney stone.\\nMany people do not ever find out that they have\\nstones in their kidneys. These stones are small enough to\\nallow the kidney to continue functioning normally , never\\ncausing any pain. These are called “silent stones. ” Kid-\\nney stones cause problems when they interfere with the\\nnormal flow of urine. They can obstruct (block) the flow\\nthrough the ureter (a tube) that carries urine from the\\nkidney to the bladder. The kidney is not accustomed to\\nexperiencing any pressure. When pressure builds from\\nbacked-up urine, the kidney may swell (hydronephrosis).\\nIf the kidney is subjected to this pressure for some time,\\nthere may be damage to the delicate kidney structures.\\nWhen the kidney stone is lodged further down the ureter,\\nthe backed-up urine may also cause the ureter to swell\\n(hydroureter). Because the ureter is a muscular tube, the\\npresence of a stone will cause the tube to go into a\\nspasm,, causing severe pain.\\nAbout 10% of all people will have a kidney stone in\\ntheir lifetime. Kidney stones are most common among\\nmale Caucasians over the age of 30, people who have\\npreviously had kidney stones, and relatives of kidney\\nstone patients.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nKidney stones can be composed of a variety of sub-\\nstances. The most common types of kidney stones are\\ndescribed here.\\nCalcium stones\\nAbout 80% of all kidney stones fall into this catego-\\nry . These stones are composed of either calcium and\\nphosphate or calcium and oxalate. People with calcium\\nstones may have other diseases that cause them to have\\nincreased blood levels of calcium. These diseases in-\\nclude primary parathyroidism, sarcoidosis, hyperthy-\\nroidism , renal tubular acidosis, multiple myeloma, hy-\\nperoxaluria, and some types of cancer.\\nStruvite stones\\nThis type accounts for 10% of all kidney stones.\\nStruvite stones are composed of magnesium ammonium\\nphosphate. These stones occur most often in patients\\nwho have had repeated urinary tract infections with cer-\\ntain types of bacteria. These bacteria produce a sub-\\nstance called urease, which increases the urine pH and\\nmakes the urine more alkaline and less acidic. This\\nchemical environment allows struvite to settle out of the\\nurine, forming stones.\\nUric acid stones\\nAbout 5% of all kidney stones are uric acid stones.\\nThese occur when increased amounts of uric acid circu-\\nlate in the bloodstream. When the uric acid content be-\\ncomes very high, it can no longer remain dissolved and\\nsolid particles of uric acid settle out of the urine. A kid-\\nney stone is formed when these particles cling to each\\nother within the kidney , slowly forming a solid mass.\\nAbout half of all patients with this type of stone also\\nhave deposits of uric acid elsewhere in their bodies,\\ncommonly in the joint of the big toe. This painful disor-\\nder is called gout . Other causes of uric acid stones in-\\nclude chemotherapy for cancer; certain bone marrow dis-\\norders in which blood cells are overproduced; and an in-\\nherited disorder called Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.\\nCystine stones\\nThese account for 2% of all kidney stones. Cystine\\nis a type of amino acid, and people with this type of kid-\\nney stone have an abnormality in the way their bodies\\nprocess amino acids in the diet.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21156\\nKidney stones\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1156'),\n",

(Custom Medical Stock Photo.\\nReproduced by permission.)\\nPatients who have kidney stones usually do not have\\nsymptoms until the stones pass into the ureter. Prior to\\nthis development, some people may notice blood in their\\nurine. Once the stone is in the ureter, however, most peo-\\nple will experience bouts of very severe pain. The pain is\\ncrampy and spasmodic, and is referred to as “colic. ” The\\npain usually begins in the flank region, the area between\\nthe lower ribs and the hip bone. As the stone moves clos-\\ner to the bladder, a patient will often feel the pain radiat-\\ning along the inner thigh. W omen may feel the pain in\\nthe vulva, while men often feel pain in the testicles.\\nNausea, vomiting, extremely frequent and painful urina-\\ntion, and blood in the urine are common. Fever and\\nchills usually mean that the ureter has become obstruct-\\ned, allowing bacteria to become trapped in the kidney\\nand cause a kidney infection (pyelonephritis).\\nDiagnosis\\nA diagnosis of kidney stones is based on the pa-\\ntient’s history of the severe distinctive pain associated\\nwith the stones. Diagnosis includes laboratory examina-\\ntion of a urine sample and an x-ray examination. During\\nthe passage of a stone, examination of the urine almost\\nalways reveals blood. A number of x-ray tests are used to\\ndiagnose kidney stones. A plain x ray of the kidneys,\\nureters, and bladder may or may not reveal the stone. A\\nseries of x rays taken after injecting iodine dye into a\\nvein is usually a more reliable way of seeing a stone.\\nThis procedure is called an intravenous pyelogram\\n(IVP). The dye “lights up” the urinary system as it trav-\\nels. In the case of an obstruction, the dye will be stopped\\nby the stone or will only be able to get past the stone at a\\nslow trickle. An ultrasound can also be used to detect\\nrenal blockage. Recently , the use of computed tomogra-\\nphy (CT) scans has been added to the diagnosis of some\\nkidney stones, more as a follow-up after treatment to de-\\ntect how fragile or intact a stone might be.\\nWhen a patient is passing a kidney stone, it is im-\\nportant that all of his or her urine is strained through a\\nspecial sieve to catch the stone. The stone can then be\\nsent to a laboratory for analysis to determine the chemi-\\ncal composition of the stone. After the kidney stone has\\nbeen passed, other tests are required to understand the\\nunderlying condition that may have caused the stone to\\nform. Collecting urine for 24 hours, followed by careful\\nanalysis of its chemical makeup, can often determine the\\nreason for stone formation.\\nT reatment\\nIt is believed that stones may pass more quickly if\\nthe patient is encouraged to drink large amounts of water\\n(2–3 quarts per day).\\nHerbal remedies that have anti-lithic (stone-dissolv-\\ning) action can assist in dissolving small kidney stones.\\nThese include gravel root ( Eupatorium purpureum ), hy-\\ndrangea (Hydrangea arborescens), and wild carrot (Dau-\\ncus carota ). Starfruit ( Averrhoa carambola ) is recom-\\nmended to increase the amount of urine a patient passes\\nand to relieve pain. A Chinese herbal practitioner may\\nuse such herbs as Semen Abutili seu Malvae, Semen\\nPlantaginis, and Herba Lygodii Japonici for urinary\\nstones. Dietary changes can be made to reduce the risk\\nof future stone formation and to facilitate the resorption\\nof existing stones. Supplementation with magnesium, a\\nsmooth muscle relaxant, can help reduce pain and facili-\\ntate stone passing. Guided imagery may also be used to\\nhelp relieve pain. Extremely large stones may require\\nsurgical intervention.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nA patient with a kidney stone will say that the most\\nimportant aspect of treatment is adequate pain relief. Be-\\ncause the pain of passing a kidney stone is so severe, nar-\\ncotic pain medications (such as morphine) are usually re-\\nquired. If the patient is vomiting or unable to drink fluids\\nbecause of the pain, it may be necessary to provide intra-\\nvenous fluids. If symptoms and urine tests indicate the\\npresence of infection, antibiotics are required.\\nAlthough most kidney stones pass on their own, some\\ndo not. Surgical removal of a stone may become necessary\\nwhen a stone appears too large to pass. Surgery may also\\nbe required if the stone is causing serious obstructions,\\npain that cannot be treated, heavy bleeding, or infection.\\nSeveral alternatives exist for removing stones. One method\\ninvolves inserting a tube into the bladder and up into the\\nureter. A tiny basket is then passed through the tube, and an\\nattempt is made to snare the stone and pull it out.

These shock waves may be aimed at the stone\\nfrom outside of the body by passing the necessary equip-\\nment through the bladder and into the ureter. The shock\\nwaves may be aimed at the stone from inside the body by\\nplacing the instrument through a tiny incision located near\\nthe stone. The stone fragments may then pass on their own\\nor may be removed through the incision. These methods\\nconsiderably reduce a patient’s recovery time when com-\\npared to the traditional open operation. Some patients may\\nhave a follow-up CT scan to determine if the lithotripsy\\nprocedure successfully removed all stones.\\nExpected results\\nA patient’s prognosis depends on the underlying disor-\\nder causing the development of kidney stones. In most cases,\\npatients with uncomplicated calcium stones will recover\\nvery well. About 60% of these patients, however, will have\\nother kidney stones. Struvite stones are particularly danger-\\nous because they may grow extremely large, filling the tubes\\nwithin the kidney . These are called staghorn stones and will\\nnot pass out in the urine. They will require surgical removal.\\nUric acid stones may also become staghorn stones.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention of kidney stones depends on the type of\\nstone and the presence or absence of an underlying dis-\\nease. In almost all cases, increasing fluid intake so that a\\nperson consistently drinks several quarts of water a day\\nis an important preventative measure. Patients with calci-\\num stones may benefit from taking a medication called a\\ndiuretic, which has the effect of decreasing the amount\\nof calcium passed in the urine.

Uric acid stones may\\nrequire treatment with a medication called allopurinol.\\nStruvite stones will require removal and the patient should\\nreceive an antibiotic.

Knee pain can be a symptom of numerous\\nconditions and diseases, including knee stress , os-\\nteoarthritis, injury ,gout, infection, and bursitis.\\nDescription\\nKnee pain is very common. Each year, millions of\\nAmericans visit the doctor for knee pain. It is the most\\nfrequent reason for visits to an orthopedist (bone and\\njoint surgeon).\\nT o understand the various causes of knee pain, it is\\nimportant to know how the knee functions. The knee\\nrefers to the joint where the femur (thigh bone) meets the\\ntibia (largest lower leg bone). In front of this joint lies\\nthe patella (knee cap). The joint is lined by a membrane\\ncalled a synovial sac. The synovial sac produces syn-\\novial fluid which acts as a lubricant much in the way that\\noil lubricates the moving parts of machinery . Other tis-\\nsues that make up the knee joint include cartilage, mus-\\ncles, tendons, and ligaments. The upper end of the tibia\\nhas cartilaginous shock absorbers called menisci (singu-\\nlar meniscus). Other protective structures are the bursae,\\nwhich cushion areas of friction in the joint. Most of the\\nmuscles involved with joint mobility originate in the\\nthigh, cross the knee joint, and attach to the tibia.\\nThe knee supports two to three times a person’s body\\nweight. It is a complex joint that allows for a considerable\\nrange in mobility . In addition to simple flexion (bending) and\\nextension (straightening) movements, the knee joint is de-\\nsigned to allow for rotation, gliding, and rolling movements.\\nT o allow for complex mobility and joint stability , joint\\nstrength is sacrificed, making the knee vulnerable to injury .\\nCauses & symptoms\\nKnee pain is a symptom of many different diseases\\nand conditions. Short-term knee pain may be the result\\nof excess stress on the knee. Possible causes of knee pain\\ninclude:\\n• Arthritis. Osteoarthritis (joint degeneration), rheuma-\\ntoid arthritis (joint inflammation), and septic arthritis\\n(joint infection) can cause knee pain.\\n• Bursitis. Inflammation of the bursae of the knee can\\ncause knee pain. Bursitis, sometimes called house-\\nmaid’s knee, can be caused by infection, gout, rheuma-\\ntoid arthritis, injury , illness, or chronic irritation (crawl-\\ning or kneeling).\\n• Cysts. A cyst is a fluid-filled sac. Cysts associated with\\nthe knee can cause swelling and knee pain or discomfort.\\n• Fracture. Breakage or crack in any of the bones associ-\\nated with the knee joint can cause knee pain.\\n• Gout. A faulty chemical process leads to high levels of\\nuric acid in the blood which causes inflammatory\\narthritis, crystal deposits in joints, joint destruction, and\\njoint pain.\\n• Ligament injury or instability . The ligaments support-\\ning the knee may be injured or strained by persons who\\nparticipate in sports, particularly football, rugby ,\\nlacrosse, basketball, skiing, soccer, and volleyball.\\nOther accidents can also cause ligament damage.\\n• Loose bodies. This condition refers to any loose objects\\nthat float around the knee and cause problems. They\\nalso are called “joint mice” because of their elusive na-\\nture.\\n• Meniscus conditions. Damage, usually in the form of a\\ntear, to the menisci can result from degenerative changes\\nassociated with advancing age or sports-related injury .\\nSports that commonly cause menisci damage include\\nfootball, basketball, soccer, tennis, lacrosse, and skiing.\\n• Osteonecrosis. Degeneration of the bones associated\\nwith the knee cause pain and deformity .\\n• Patellofemoral pain. Also known as anterior knee pain\\nsyndrome, this condition is characterized by pain\\naround the knee cap. The exact cause of patellofemoral\\npain is unknown but is probably related to muscle inad-\\nequacy , lack of flexibility , rapid growth, or bone posi-\\ntioning.\\nDiagnosis\\nKnee pain can be diagnosed and treated by an ortho-\\npedic surgeon. Diagnosis is based primarily on medical\\nhistory and physical exam. The diagnosis begins with a\\ndetailed medical history to fully characterize the knee\\npain. The knee will be bent to determine the range of\\nmotion and palpated (felt with the hands) to detect the\\npresence of any abnormalities. The physical exam may\\ninclude any of a number of different tests designed to de-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 21160\\nKnee pain\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1160'),\n",

Pressing the Stomach 36 point located\\nbelow the knee caps tones muscles and relieves joint\\npain anywhere in the body . Pressing the Spleen 9 points\\nlocated below the kneecap on the inside of each leg re-\\nlieves knee pain.\\n• Acupuncture . Inflammation and pain may be relieved\\nby acupuncture. The large intestine meridian is the\\nmost effective channel for pain relief.

He initially\\ntook up his father’s trade of weaving, but longed to be-\\ncome a priest. With help from a sympathetic clergyman,\\nhe was admitted to high school as a mature student, but\\nafter five years of intensive studies, Kneipp became seri-\\nously ill with pulmonary tuberculosis . At that time, the\\ndisease was usually fatal, but Kneipp came across an\\neighteenth-century book about hydrotherapy that in-\\nspired him during the winter of 1849 to immerse himself\\nseveral times a week in the icy Danube River. These\\nbrief exposures to cold water seemed to bolster his im-\\nmune system, because Kneipp’s tuberculosis went into\\nremission and he was able to continue his theological\\nstudies in Munich. There, he convinced some of his fel-\\nlow students to join his experiments with hydrotherapy .\\nKneipp was ordained as a priest in 1852. In that ca-\\npacity , he began using hydrotherapy to help some of his\\npoorer parishioners. He broadened his approach to in-\\nclude herbalism, exercise, and other elements, and toned\\ndown his initial enthusiasm for shocking the body with\\ncold water. “I warn all against too-frequent application\\nof cold water, ” he later wrote. “Three times I concluded\\nto remodel my system and relax the treatment from\\nseverity to mildness and thence to greater mildness still. ”\\nKneipp’s reputation grew after a number of dying pa-\\ntients recovered when he was called to administer last\\nrites and managed instead to restore them to health. In\\n1855 he was assigned to W orishofen, a village in the\\nfoothills of the Bavarian Alps that soon developed an in-\\nternational reputation as a place of healing. Kneipp sum-\\nmarized his teachings in two popular books, My W ater\\nCure in 1886 and So Sollt Ihr Leben (Thus Thou Shalt\\nLive) in 1889. Supporters of his techniques formed\\nKneipp Societies in Germany and the United States.\\nFather Kneipp was later named a monsignor by\\nPope Leo XIII. After his death in W orishofen on June 17,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1163\\nKneipp wellness\\nBorn in Stephansreid, Bavaria, Germany , of poor\\nparents, Sebastian Kneipp’ s childhood was filled with\\nlabor , much of it learning weaving from his father . Even\\nas a child, Kneipp wanted to become a priest. With the\\nhelp of a priest who befriended him, Kneipp entered high\\nschool where he studied theology for five years. During\\nthis time, he contracted consumption (pulmonary tuber-\\nculosis), usually a fatal disease at that time. While ill, he\\nread an eighteenth-century book on hydrotherapy by Dr .\\nHahn. This book advised him to bathe two or three times\\na week in the icy Danube River to stimulate his immune\\nsystem. His tuberculosis went into remission, his health\\nimproved, and in 1850, he entered a seminary in Mu-\\nnich. He continued his hydrotherapy and convinced\\nother theological students to practice it. Kneipp was or-\\ndained a priest in 1852. During the next few years, he\\nwas called to the bedsides of many patients to perform\\nthe last rites. Instead he successfully treated a number of\\nthe patients with hydrotherapy .\\nHe perfected his own system of hydrotherapy and his\\nsuccessful treatment of the poor attracted much attention.\\nPeople came from throughout Germany to be healed by\\nKneipp’ s hydrotherapy . His success fostered resentment\\nfrom physicians; at one point, he was charged in German\\ncourts with quackery , where he was subsequently acquit-\\nted. In 1886, he published My Water Cure , which was\\ntranslated into several languages and became popular\\nthroughout Europe. He continued to refine his treatment\\nfrom one of severity to milder versions. It consisted of\\nbathing in and drinking cold water , going to bed and rising\\nearly , long barefoot walks in wet grass, and simple meals\\nconsisting of little meat and large quantities of whole-grain\\ncereals.

A Journal of\\nAmerican Medicine cites a study of kola nut’s effects on\\nasthma that showed “the attack being cut short and the\\nchild’s condition rapidly improved. ”\\nGastrointestinal disorders\\nIn Africa, the fresh nuts are chewed as a ceremonial\\ngreeting, as a stimulant, and to help aid digestion, as kola\\nnut stimulates gastric acid production. Kola nuts are also\\nknown to improve the taste of food and act as an appetite\\nsuppressant.\\nOther conditions\\nThe kola nut is also used to treat migraine headaches,\\nbecause the caffeine and theobromine act as cerebral va-\\nBrazil, where they were introduced by African slaves.\\nAll three species are used as a stimulant and are prepared\\nin the same manner. The kola tree grows to approximate-\\nly 40 ft (12 m) in height, and has white to yellow flowers\\nwith spots that range from red to purple. The kola tree’s\\nleaves are 6–8 in long (15–20 cm) and the tree bears fruit\\nthat is shaped like a star. Inside the fruit, about a dozen\\nround or square seeds can be found in a white seed shell.\\nGeneral use\\nKola nut, which contains high amounts of caffeine ,\\nhelps combat fatigue and is most commonly used as a\\ncentral nervous system stimulant that focuses on the\\ncerebrospinal centers. It also contains theobromine, a\\nstimulant found in chocolate as well as in green tea .\\nKola nut also contains tannins, phenolics, phlobaphens,\\nkola red, betaine, protein, starch, fat, thiamine , ri-\\nboflavin, and niacin. The Journal of the American Med-\\nical Association advocates the use of kola over other\\nstimulants, because it is not addictive and does not lead\\nto depression.

The cotyle-\\ndons are white and bitter when they are fresh, but they\\nturn reddish with almost no taste when they are dried.\\nFresh nuts are difficult to find outside of the tropical areas\\nwhere they are grown. Sometimes, the nuts are sold at\\nAfrican markets in international cities, like W ashington\\nD.C. The dried cotyledons are 1–2 in (2.5–5 cm) long.\\nDosage of kola nut should be 2–6 g per day , as\\n2.5–7.5 g of liquid extract or 10–30 g per day of tincture.\\nPowdered cotyledons should be taken at 1-3 g per day , as\\na decoction, liquid extract, or tincture.

Tinctures\\nin a 1:5 solution of 60% alcohol, with 1-4 ml of the\\ncotyledons three times a day .\\nPrecautions\\nBecause of its use as a stimulant, kola nut should be\\nused with caution. Patients should consult with their doc-\\ntors, especially if they are taking other medications. Due\\nto its caffeine content, kola nut should not be used by\\nwomen who are pregnant or nursing a child. Also be-\\ncause of its caffeine content, it is not advisable for those\\nsuffering from insomnia or anxiety problems. In some\\ncases, extreme restlessness and sleepnessness can occur.\\nIt should not be used by patients with a history of high\\nblood pressure, heart trouble, palpitations, seizures, in-\\nsomnia, heart disease , high cholesterol , or stroke. Re-\\nsearch in Niger showed that the habitual chewing of kola\\nnut can actually cause cardiac arrythmias, based on clini-\\ncal trials using cats. Kola nut should not be used by those\\nwith stomach or duodenal ulcers because it increases\\ngastric juice production and may add to gastrointestinal\\ndiscomfort and disorders. Kola nut is also one of the top\\nten common food allergens, among cow’s milk and\\nchocolate. Kola nut is naturally very high in tannin, a\\nwhite-to-yellow astringent powder that gets its name\\nfrom its use as a textile and leather tanning agent. How-\\never, a University of Miami study shows that “tannins\\nare increasingly recognized as dietary carcinogens and\\nas antinutrients interfering with the system’s full use of\\nprotein” and called for more studies correlating early\\ndeath and regular kola nut use in third world countries.\\nKola nut should not be used for long periods of time.\\nKola nut and cola beverages should be kept away\\nfrom dogs, cats, and other domestic animals. The theo-\\nbromine in kola nut (and in chocolate as well) can be\\nfatal to these pets because they metabolize it much more\\nslowly than humans.\\nSide effects\\nKola nut may cause insomnia, anxiety , nervousness,\\ngastrointestinal problems, and tremors. If there is any in-\\ndication of an overdose,diarrhea, nausea, and/or cramps\\nmay follow . Oral blisters have also been known to form.\\nHeavy use of kola nut or drinking large quantities of\\ncola beverages has been associated with bone loss in\\nadults and inhibition of bone formation in adolescents.\\nSome practitioners are recommending that teenagers\\nshould restrict intake of soft drinks containing cola in\\norder to lower their risk of osteoporosis in later life.\\nInteractions\\nKola nut should not be used with muscle relaxants,\\nheart medications, high blood pressure medication, ni-\\ntrates and calcium-channel blockers.\\nClinical experiments indicate that beverages contain-\\ning cola increase the rate and extent of absorption of car-\\nbamazepine (T egretol), a drug used to treat epilepsy and\\nsome forms of bipolar disorder . Kola nut has been re-\\nported to interact with tricyclic antidepressant medications\\nand with MAO inhibitors.

In general, prop-\\nerly fermented foods have been shown to aid in the\\ngrowth of beneficial intestinal flora, reduce the growth of\\nharmful yeasts and bacteria in the digestive tract, and im-\\nprove digestion and absorption. Some testimonial claims\\nhave also been made by cancer and AIDS patients.\\nPreparations\\nKombucha tea is available in several forms. Kits in-\\nclude the fungi and all ingredients, as well as directions to\\nmake the brew at home. The fungi may also be purchased\\nseparately . Dried kombucha is available in capsule form.\\nMaking the tea from scratch is a process similar to\\npreparing yogurt, sauerkraut, and other fermented foods. In-\\nstructions should be followed carefully . Particular care\\nshould be taken to maintain the cleanliness of the tea-mak-\\ning process, to avoid contamination by mold or unhealthy\\nbacteria (a cause of health problems in those drinking poor-\\nquality kombucha). Smoking in the same room as the mix-\\nture may contaminate it. Mold typically appears as green,\\npink, or black blotches in the culture, and should be thor-\\noughly removed and discarded. The fermentation process is\\ngenerally successful if the kombucha skin remains firm and\\nrubbery . Care should be taken if the membrane becomes\\ncrumbly or discolored. On average, the fermentation of\\nkombucha tea takes 12–14 days. After fermentation, new\\nbatches can be easily made from the existing culture.\\nWhen using the supplement in pill form, consumers\\ncan follow the manufacturer’s recommended dosages.\\nUsers of the tea can drink up to three cups of the bever-\\nage per day with food or between meals.\\nHistorically , kombucha was consumed as a tea. The\\nhealth benefits of other forms of the supplement have not\\nbeen compared with the original therapeutic beverage.\\nThere are reports of consumer illness from home-pre-\\npared kombucha. This may have been due to tea that was\\ntoo old, infected with molds or other contaminants, or\\nhad other problems. Consumers must be alert to the risks\\nof home-prepared fermentation methods.\\nPrecautions\\nSeveral precautions concerning kombucha tea have\\nbeen issued. Because the beverage is fermented at home,\\nthere is the risk that the liquid can become contaminated\\nby such dangerous bacteria as anthrax. People with com-\\npromised immune systems must be extremely careful not\\nto consume contaminated fermentations. Due to the high\\nacidity of the drink, the tea should not be placed in metal\\ncontainers or in pottery that has a lead glaze finish. There\\nhave been reported cases of lead poisoning and anthrax\\ndue to drinking kombucha tea that has been improperly\\nprepared. The United States Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) issued a warning concerning the danger of lead poi-\\nsoning from improperly made kombucha tea. Kombucha\\ntea is not recommended for pregnant or nursing mothers.\\nSide Effects\\nConsumption of kombucha tea has been observed to\\ncause stomach upset, yeast infections, allergic reactions,\\nnausea , and headache . Persons with stomach ulcers\\nmay find that kombucha increases their symptoms. Due\\nto harmful bacteria that can survive in the culture, ingest-\\ning contaminated tea can be dangerous or fatal.\\nInteractions\\nKombucha tea is high in acidity and should not be\\nconsumed by those taking medications that make them\\nsusceptible to increased gastrointestinal acidity . The tea\\ncontains a small amount of alcohol and should not be\\nconsumed with any medications that interact unfavorably\\nwith alcohol. The tea should not be taken by people with\\nstabilized alcoholism, to avoid aggravating the condition.\\nSome people report general and specific improved\\nhealth from moderate use of kombucha tea.

It is also known as\\nGe-gen, kudzu vine, mile-a-minute vine, foot-a-night vine,\\nand the vine-that-ate-the-South. The latter names refer to this\\nvine’s property of rapid growth. This perennial trails, climbs,\\nand winds its rough vines around tree poles and anything\\nelse it touches. It grows in shady areas, mountain areas,\\nfields, roadsides and forests in China, Japan, and the south-\\nern United States, more so in the latter because when im-\\nported, its native insects did not tag along. Kudzu was first\\nseen in the United States as an ornamental plant at the 1876\\nPhiladelphia Centennial Exposition. During the Depression,\\nthe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) im-\\nported kudzu for erosion control. In 1972, the USDA classi-\\nfied kudzu as a weed because the plant can reach 60 ft\\n(18.29 m) in a single growing season. In June and July , the\\nvines sport purple flowers and in autumn, the leaves shed.\\nThe kudzu root, which can grow to the size of a\\nhuman being, has a history of use in Chinese medicine.\\nKudzu contains daidzein, an isoflavone, and diadzin and\\npuerarin, isoflavone glycosides. The isoflavone amount\\ncan range from 1.77–12.08%, based on kudzu’s growing\\nconditions. The highest isoflavone is puerarin with di-\\nadzin and daidzein, next in isoflavone amounts. A study\\nat the University of Michigan compared legumes for\\ntheir sources of the isoflavones of genistein and\\ndaidzein, The results showed the kudzu root as a good\\nnutritional source of those two components.\\nThe root also supports bacteria that grab nitrogen\\nfrom the atmosphere and put it in the soil. This factor\\nmay explain kudzu’s rapid growth and its success in\\nfeeding Angora goats raised by Tuskegee University re-\\nsearcher Dr. Errol G. Rhoden.\\nGeneral use\\nT raditional uses\\nT raditional Chinese medicine has used kudzu,\\nwhose Chinese name is ge gan , for centuries. Kudzu’s\\nmedicinal uses were first recorded in Shen Nong’s herbal\\ntext, published around A.D. 100. Chinese medicine rec-\\nommends kudzu for what it calls wei, or superficial syn-\\ndrome, referring to a mild disease that appears just below\\nthe body’s surface and is accompanied by a fever. Chi-\\nnese medicine also indicates using kudzu for thirst,\\nheadaches (migraine and other types of headaches), neck\\npain from hypertension , angina , allergies , diarrhea ,\\nand speeding the progression of measles in children. In\\ngeneral, kudzu is used as a demulcent, or medication\\ngiven to soothe irritated mucous membranes.\\nCardiovascular disease\\nOne alternative practitioner has stated that because\\nkudzu improves the body’s flow of blood and levels of\\noxygen and opens heart vessels, it might help the cardio-\\nvascular system. Another researcher, James Duke, refers\\nto a Chinese clinical study that showed that kudzu can\\nbenefit angina sufferers. For a period of 1–6 months, 71\\nparticipants took 10–15 gm of kudzu root extract. The\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1169'),\n",

The results of this test\\nshowed no significant difference in sobriety or alcohol\\ncravings in either group.\\nPreparations\\nThe problems of manufacturing kudzu root as a drug\\nto treat alcoholism and other disorders were outlined in\\nan article on traditional Chinese medicine by Dr. James\\nZhou. Zhou says that herbs lose their natural balance\\nwhen manufacturers purify , refine, and treat them with\\nchemicals. The daidzein, in kudzu could treat alcoholism,\\nbut the purification process destroys the isoflavone bal-\\nance. Because it is the isoflavone puerarin in kudzu that\\nstops cardiovascular damage impairment and may pre-\\nvent an alcoholic side effect, liver damage, Zhou believes\\nthat the herb should be given in its natural state.\\nFor angina pectoris, practitioners of traditional Chi-\\nnese medicine recommend 30–120 mg of standardized\\ntablets of kudzu root two to three times daily . T en mg of\\na standardized tablet equals 1.5 g of the pure root. Tinc-\\ntures of 1–2 ml three to five times daily are recommend-\\ned in place of tablets. T o help lower cravings for alcohol,\\nthe recommended dosage is 3–5 g of kudzu root three\\ntimes daily or 3–4 ml of tincture three times daily . The\\nAll-In-One-Guide to Natural Remedies and Supplements\\nrecommends drinking kudzu tea to combat alcoholism.\\nAn alternative form of treatment involves taking 1500-\\nmg supplements or cubes before or after the alcohol. The\\n1500 mg can be divided equally into three daily doses.\\nKudzu also comes in supplements combined with\\nSt. John’s wort to treat the symptoms of alcoholism.\\nOne capsule is taken with each meal on a daily basis.\\nKudzu leaves can also be used in cooking, for exam-\\nple in quiches and as a deep-fried dish.\\nPrecautions\\nKudzu should not be taken by pregnant and lactating\\nwomen. In traditional Chinese practice, people who\\nsweat too much or have cold in their stomach should\\navoid kudzu because it is given for “wind-heat” illnesses.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AL TERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1171\\nKudzu\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nDaidzein—An isoflavone contained in kudzu that\\nappears to be useful in treating alcoholism.\\nDemulcent —A substance or medication given to\\nsoothe irritated or inflamed mucous membranes.\\nKudzu is used as a demulcent in traditional Chi-\\nnese medicine.\\nEthanol —Another name for the alcohol found in\\nalcoholic drinks.\\nExtract —A concentrated form of the herb made\\nby pressing the herb with a hydraulic press, soak-\\ning it in water or alcohol, then allowing the excess\\nwater or alcohol to evaporate.\\nTincture —A liquid herbal preparation, made by\\nsoaking the herb in alcohol or a mixture of alco-\\nhol and water .\\nGEAM - D to K  10/11/04 3:25 PM  Page 1171')]"
